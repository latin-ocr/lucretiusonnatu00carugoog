cases the result is produced by two airs. To proceed,
the right side of our body is seen in mirrors to be on
the left, because when the image comes and strikes
on the plane os the mirror, it is not turned back 3
unaltered‚ but is beaten out in a ri ht line backwards, ω
just as if you were to take a plaster mask before it is
dry and dash it on a pillar or beam, and it sorthwith
were to preserve the lines os its features undistorted
in front and were to strike out an exact copy os itself
straight backwards. The result will be that the eye ¹
which was right will now be lest3 and conversely the

transmitted from one mirror to another that five or
six idols are osten produced. And thus all the things
which lurk in the inmost comers os a house, however
far they are withdrawn into tortuous recesses, may
yet be all brought out through winding passages by ⁸
the aid of a number of mirrors and be seen to be
in the house. So unsailingly does the image reflect
itsell from mirror to mirr0r; and when the left side
is presented, it becomes the right in the new image;
then it is changed back again and turns round to
what it was. Moreover all little sides of mirrors
which possess a curvature resembling our side, send
back to us idols with their right corresponding to our
right either for this reason, because the image is
transmitted from one mirror to another, and then
after it has been twice struck out flies to uS, or else
because the image, when it has come to the mirror,
