what difference will there be? There will be no
distinction at all; for how absolutely infinite soever
the whole sum is, yet the things which are smallest
will equally consist ol infinite parts. Now since on
this head true reason protests and denies that the
mind can believe it, you must yield and admit that
*there exist such things as are possessed os no parts
and areos a least nature. And since these exist,
those first bodies also you must admit to be solid
and everlasting. Once more, is nature creatress os
things ¹had been wont to compel all things to be
broken up into least parts, then too she would be
unable to reproduce anything out of those parts,
because those things which are enriched with no

parts cannot have the properties which begetting
matter ought to have, Imean the various entangle·

For which reasons they who have held fire to be
the matter ol things and the sum to be formed out of
fire alone, are seen to have strayed most widely from

is they are formed out of fire one and unmixed: it
would avail nothing lor hot fire to be condensed or
, rateried, is the same nature which the whole ine has,
