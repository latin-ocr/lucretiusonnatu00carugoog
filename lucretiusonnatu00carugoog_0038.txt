14 LUCRETIUS [soon

For on what side 1 ,ask can the scaly creatores move
forwards, unless the waters have first made room?
again on what side can the waters give place, so long
as the fish are unable to go on? Therefore you must
either strip all bodies of motion or admit thatin -
things void is mixed up from which every thing gets
its first start in moving. Lastly if two broad bodies
after contact quickly spring asunder‚ the air must
Ι surely fill all the void which is formed between the
bodies. Well however rapidly it stream together
with swift- -circling currents‚ yet the whole space will
not be able to be filled up in one moment for it ι
must occupy first one spot and then anotheh, until l
the whole rs taken up. But if haply any one sup·
poses that, when the bodies have started asunder, ·
that result follows because the air condenses‚ he rs
mistaken3 for a void is then formed which was not
before, and a void also is filled which existed before;
nor can the air condense in suchaway, nor supposing
it could, could it methinks without void draw into
itself and bring its parts together.
Wherefore however long you hold out by urging

many objections, you must needs in the end admit
that there is a void in things And many more
arguments 1 may state to you in order to accumulate
proof on my words ; but these slight footprints are
enough for a keen·searching mind to enable you by
yourself to find out all the rest For as dogs often
discover by smell the lair of a mountain-ranging wild

beast though covered over with leaves, when once
they have got on the sure tracks, thus you in cases
like this will be able by yourself alone to see one
thing after another and find your way into all dark
