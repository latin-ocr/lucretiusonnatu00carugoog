belonged to the parts 01 fire as well. The heat would
be more intense by compression 01 parts, more saint

by their severance and dispersion. More than this
you cannot think it in the power 01 such causes 10
effect, sar less could so great a diversityof things
come lrom mere density and rarity 01 fires. Observe
also, il they suppose void to be mixed up in things,
fire may then be condensed and lest rare; but because
they see many things rise up in contradiction to
them and shrink hom leaving unmixed void in
things, fearing the steep, they lose the true road,
and do not perceive on the other hand that if void
is taken from things, all things are condensed and e
out 01 011 things is formed one single body, which
cannot briskly radiate anything from it, in the way
heat-giving fire emits light and warmth, letting you
see that it is not 01 closely compressed parts. But il
they haply think that in some other way fires may
be quenched in the union and change their body, you
are to know that if they shall scruple on no side
to do this, 011 heat sure enough will be utterly
brought to nothing, and all things that are produced
will be formed out 01 nothing. For whenevcr a
thing changes and quits its proper limits, at once this
change 01 state is the death 01 that which was belore. '
Therefore something or other must needs be lest to
those fires 01 theirs undestroyed, that you may not
have 011 things absolutely returning to nothing, and
the whole store 01 things born anew and flourishing
out 01 nothing. Since then in lact there are some
most unquestionable bodies which always preserve the
same nature, on whose going or coming and· change
