svs-936] LUCRETIUS 201

Wherelore also he who fables that in the new tirne of
the earth and the fresh youth os heaven such living
creatures could have been begotten, resting upon
this one sutile term new, may babble out many
things in like sashion, may say that rivers then ran
with gold over all parts ol the earth and that trees
were wont to blossom with precious stones, or that
man was born with such giant force oi srame that he
could wade on loot across deep seas and whirl the
whole heaven about him with his hands. For the
fact that there were many seeds os things in the
earth what time it first shed forth living creatures‚ is
yet noproof that there could have been produced
beasts os different kinds mixed together, and limbs
ol' different living things formed intua single srame‚.
because the ‘kinds oi herbage and corn and joyous
trees which even now spring in plenty out os the
earth yet cannot be produced with 'the several sorts
plaited into one, but each thing goes on aster its own
sashion, and all preserve their distinctive differences
according to a fixed law oi nature.
‘A But the race oi man then in the fields was much i
rdier, as beseerned it to be, since the hard earthl
had produced it; and built ona groundwork of larger
and more solid bones within, knit with powerful
sinews throughout the frame of flesh; not lightly to
be disabled by heat or cold or strange kinds os food
or any malady os body. And during the revolution
oi many lustres oi the sun through heaven they led a
lise after the roving sashion of wild beasts, No one
then was a sturdy guider oi the bent plough or knew
how to labour the fields with iron or plant in the
ground young saplings or lop witb pruning-‘nooks <hb
