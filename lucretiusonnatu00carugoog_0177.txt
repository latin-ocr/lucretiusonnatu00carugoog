cases the result is produced by two airs. To proceed,
the right side oi our body is seen in mirrors to be on
the lest, because when the image comes and strikes
on the plane ol the mirror, itis not turned back 2

in the house. So unfailingly does the image reflect
itseli srom mirror to mirror; and when the left side
is presented, it becomes the right in the new image;
then it is changed back again and turns round to
what it was. Moreover all little sides os mirrors
which possess a curvature resembling our side, send

right either for this reason, because the image is
transmitted from one mirror to another, and then
