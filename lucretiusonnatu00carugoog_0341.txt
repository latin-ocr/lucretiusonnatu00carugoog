The Nile rises every summer and overflows the
plains‚ that one sole river throughout the whole land
of Egypt. It waters Egypt often in the middle of
the hot season, either because in summer there are
north winds opposite its mouths, which at that time
oi year go by the name of etesian winds. Blowing
up the river they retard it and driving the waters
backwards fill its channel full and force the river to ”
stand sti11; sor beyond a doubt these blasts which
start from the icy constellations of the pole are carried
right up the stream. That river comes from the
south out os the beat-fraught country, rising far up
from the central region of day among races of men
black in their sun-baked complexion. It is quite
possible too that the great accumulation of sand may
bar up the mouths against the opposing waves, when

'the sea stirred up by the winds throws up the sand

within the channel; whereby the outlet os the river
is rendered less free and the current of the waters at
the same time less rapid in its downward flow. It
may be also that the rains are more frequent at its
source in that season, because the etesian blasts os
the north winds drive all the clouds together into
those parts at that time. And, you are to know,
when they have been driven on to the central region
os day and have gathered together, then the clouds
jammed close against the high mountains are massed
together and violently compressed. Perhaps too it
gets its increase high up from the losty mountains os
the Ethiopians when the all-surveying sun with his
‘thawing rays constrains the white snows to descend
into the plains.

Now mark, and I will make clear to you what
