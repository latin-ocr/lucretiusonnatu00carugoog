of mirrors in the spot they do, since in both the given
cases the result is produced by two airs. To proceed,
the right side of our body is seen in mirrors to beon
the lest, because when the image comes and strikes
on the plane os the mirror, it is not turned back ².
unaltered, but is beaten out in ari ht line backwards, ἶ.
just as if you were to take a plaster mask before it is
dry and dash it on a pillar or beam, and it sorthwith
were to preserve the lines ol its features undistorted

in front and were to strike out an exact copy os itself
straight backwards. The result will be that the eye ¹
which was right will now be left; and conversely the
lest become the right An image may also be so
transmitted from one mirror to another that five or
six idols are osten produced. And thus all the things
which lurk in the inmost corners os a house, however
far they are withdrawn into tortuous recesses, may
yet be all brought out through winding passages by ‘
the aid ol a number os mirrors and be seen to be
in the house So unfailingly does the image reflect
itsell from mirror to mirror; and when the lest side

is presented, it becomes the right in the new image;
then it is changed back again and turns round to
what it was. Moreover all little sides os mirrors
which possess a curvature resembling our side, send
back to us idols with their right corresponding to our
right either for this reason, because the image is
transmitted from one mirror to another, and then
after it has been twice struck out flies to us, or else
because the image, when it has come to the mirror,
wheels about, because the curved shape os the mirror
teaches it to turn round and sace us. Again you ’.

would think that idols step out and put uouemere!
