loeo-1094] LUCRETIUS 121

from the time past in death nor can we iret anything
away, whereby we may haply be a less long time in
the condition of the dead. Therefore you may com-
plete as many generations as you please during your
life3 none the less however will that everlasting death
await you; and ior no less long a time will he be no
more in being, who beginning with to-day has ended‘
his life, than the man who has died many months ἦ

and years ag0.
