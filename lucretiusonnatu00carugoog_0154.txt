through the length and breadth os heaven, lly over ῃ
sea and lands and flood the heaven, what then os
those which stand ready posted in front rank, when
they are discharged and nothing obstructs their
egress? how much laster, you see, and larther must
they travel, scouring through many times the same
amount os space in the same time that the sunlight
takes to spread over heaven l This too appears to be
an eminently- true proof of the velocity with which
idols ol things are borne along: as soon as ever the
brightness ol water is set down in the open air, il the
heaven is starry, in a moment the clear radiant con-
stellations os ether imaged in the water correspond to
those in the heaven. Now do you see in what a
moment ol time an image drops down from the
borders os heaven to the borders of earth? Therefore
again and again I repeat you must admit that bodies
capable os striking the eyes and of provoking vision
[constantly travel] with a marvellous [velocity].
Smells too incessantly stream from certain things;
as does cold (τοττι rivers, heat from the sun, spray
from the waves ,ol the sea, that enter into walls near
the shore Various sounds also cease not to fly
through the air. Then too a moist salt flavour often
comes into the mouth, when we are moving about
beside the sea; and when we look¹ on at the mixing
of a decoction ol wormwood, its bitterness affects us.
In such a constant stream from all things the several
qualities are carried and are transmitted in all direc-
tions round, and no delay, no respite in the flow is ever
granted, since we constantly have feeling, and may at
any time see smell and hear the sound of anything.
Again since a particular figure felt by the hands
