barbed points, but rather to have minute angles
slightly projecting‚ so that they can tickle rat er
than hurt the senses; oi which class tartaros wine
is formed and the flavours of elecampane. Again
that hot fires and cold irost have fangs oi a dissimilar
kind wherewith to pierce the semes, is proved to us
by the touch ol each. For touch, touch, ye holy
divinities oi the gods, the body's feeling is, either
when an extraneous thing makes its way in, or when
a thing which is born in the body hurts it, or gives
pleasure as it issues sorth by the birth-bestowing
ways of Venus, or when from some collision the seeds
are disordered within the body and distract the feeling
by their mutual disturbance; as ii haply you were
yoursell to strike with the hand any part ol the body
you please and so make trial. Wherefore the shapes
of the first-beginnings must differ ὼγ, since they
’ are able to give birth to different leelings.

Again things which look to us hard and dense
²⁰2 must consist ol particles more hooked together, and ,
³* be held in union because 'vildedun through with
sgr branchlike elements. In this class first oi all diamond
stones stand in loremost line inured to despise blows,
and stout blocks os basalt and the strength ol hard
iron and brass bolts which scream out as they hold
last to their staples. Those things which are liquid
and ol fluid body ought to consist more ol smooth
· and round elements ; sor the several drops have no
mutual cohesion and their onward course too hasa
ready flow downwards. All things lastly which you
see disperse themselves in an instant, as smoke mists
and flames, il they do not consist entirely os smooth
aud round, must yet not be held last by closely
