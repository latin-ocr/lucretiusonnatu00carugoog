138 LUCRETIUS [noos iv

suppose the credit of the senses to be shaken on all
hands. Then to people unacquainted with the sea
ships in harbour seem to be all askew and with poop-
fittings broken to be pressing up against the water.
For whatever part of the oars is raised above the salt
q water, is straight, and the rudders in their upper half

are straight: the parts which are sunk below the
water-level, appear to be broken and bent round and
to slope up and turn back towards the suriace and to
be so much twisted back as wellnigh to float on the
top oi the water. And when the winds carry the
thinly scattered clouds across heaven in the night-
time, then do the glittering signs appear to glide

’ athwart the rack and to be travelling on high in a

direction quite different to their real course. Then if
our hand chance to be placed beneath one eye and
press it below, through a certain sensation all things
which we look at appear then to become double as
we look; the light of lamps brilliant with flames to
be double, double too the furniture through the whole
house, double men's faces and men’s bodies. Again
when sleep has chained down our limbs in sweet
slumber and the whole body is sunk in profound
repose‚ yet then we seem to ourselves to be awake
and to be moving our limbs, and mid the thick dark-
ness of night we think we see the sun and the day-
light3 and though in a confined room‚ we seem to be
passing to new climates seas rivers and mountains
and to be crossing plains on ioot and to hear noiseS,
though the austere silence of night prevails all round,
and to be uttering speech though quite silent. Many
are the other marvels of this sort we see, which all
seek to shake as it were the credit of the senses:
