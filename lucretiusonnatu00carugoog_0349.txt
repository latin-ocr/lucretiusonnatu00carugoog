mesor] LUCRETIUS 255

since we constantly have feeling, and may at any
time see, smell and hear the sound os anything.

And now I will state once again how rare a body
all things have: a question made clear in the first
part of my poem also: although the knowledge os this
isos importance in regard to many things, above all
in regard to this very question which I am coming to
discusS, at the very outset it is necessary to establish
that nothing comes under sense save body mixed
with void. For instance in caves rocks overhead
sweat with moisture and trickle down in oozing

drops. Sweat too oozes out from our whole body ;
the beard grows, and hairs over all our limbs and
frame. Food is distributed through all the veins,
gives increase and nourishment to the very ex-
tremities and nails. We ieel too cold and heat pass

through brass, we feel them pass through gold and
silver, when we hold full cups. Again voices fly
through the stone partitions os houses; smell passes
through and cold, and the heat of fire which is wont
ay to pierce even the strength oi iron, where the
Gaulish cuirass girds the body round. And when a
storm has gathered in earth and heaven, and when
along with it the influence of disease makes its way
in irom without, they both withdraw respectively to
heaven and earth and 'there work their wills, since
there is nothing at all that is notos a rare texture
of‘bod .

Furihermore all bodies whatever which are dis-
charged from things are not qualified to excite the , ’
same sensations nor are adapted sor all things alike
The sun sor instance bakes and dries up the earth,
but thaws ice, and forces the snows oiied uo high
