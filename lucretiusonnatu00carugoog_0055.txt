more combinations out os which different things can

Anaxagoras as the Greeks term it, which the poverty
os our native speech does not allow us to name in our
own tongue3 though it is easy enough to set forth in
words the thing itsels. First ol all then, when he
speaks of the homoeomeria os things, you must know

both these grounds to be as much mistaken as those
‘whom we have already spoken ol above. Moreover
