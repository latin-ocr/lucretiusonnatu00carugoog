τ But Centaurs never have existed, and at no time
i can there exist things oi twosold nature and double
ἰ body formed into one frame out oi limbs os alien
⁴ kinds, such that the iaculties and powers of this and

that portion cannot be sufficiently like. ’ This how·

ever dull os understanding you may leam from what

follows To begin, a horse when three years have
, gone round is in the prime oi his vigour, far different
the boy: often even at that age he will call in his
⁴ ’ sleep lor the milk oi the breast. Asterwards when in
advanced age his lusty strength and limbs now saint
with ebbing life sail the horse, then and not till then
youth in the flower of age commences sor that boy
and clothes his cheeks in soit down ; that you may
-not haply believe that out of a man and the burden-
carrying seed oi horses Centaurs can be formed and
¹ have being; or that Scyllas with bodies hali those of
fishes girdled round with raving dogs can exist, and
all other things oi the kind, whose limbs we see
cannot harmoniae together; as they neither come to
their flower at the same time nor reach the sulness
os their bodily strength nor lose it in advanced old
age, nor burn with similar passions nor have com·
patible manners, nor feel the same things give
pleasure throughout their frames. Thus we may see
bearded goats osten satten on hemlock which forman
is rank poison. Since flame moreover is wont to
scorch and burn the tawny bodies os lions just as
much as any other kind oi flesh and blood existing
on earth, how could it bc that a single chimera with

triple body, in fronta lion, behind a dragon, in the
middle the goat whose name it bears, could breathe
out at the mouth herce hamc (τοττι its body?
