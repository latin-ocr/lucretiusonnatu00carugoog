nothing, methinks: so wondrous strange had been
this sight, Yet how little, you know, wearied as all
are to satiety with seeing, any one now cares to look
up into heaven’s glittering quartersl Cease therefore
to be dismayed by the mere novelty and so to reject
reason from your mind with loathing: weigh the

has been made by nature, just as the seeds os things
have chanced spontaneously to clash, alter being
brought together in manisold wise without purpose,
without soresight, without result, and at last have
filtered through such sceds as, suddenly thrown Δ
together, were fitted to become on each occasion the l
rudiments os great things, ol earth sea and neuwen
