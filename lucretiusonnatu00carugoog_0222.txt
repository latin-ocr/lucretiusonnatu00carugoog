pursue great aims under great emotions, often during
sleep pursue and carry on the same in like manner;
kings take by storm, are taken, join battle, raise a
loud cry as if stabbed on the spot Many struggle
hard and utter groans in pain, and as ii gnawed by
the bite oi panther or cruel lion fill all the place with
loud cries. Many during sleep speak of important
affairs and have often and often disclosed their own
guilt. Many meet death3 many as il tumbling down
from high precipiens to the ground with their whole
body, are scared with terror and aiter sleep as ir out
oi their judgment scarce come to themselves again,
quite disordered by their body’s turmoil. Again a

lace and a beautiful bloom, which stir and excite
the frame.

in us, as soon as ripe age fortifies the frame. For as
different causes setin motion and excite different
things, so from man the sole influence of man draws
forth human seed. As soon then as it has been
forced out frorn and quits its proper scats throughout
the limbs and frame, it withdraws itself from the
