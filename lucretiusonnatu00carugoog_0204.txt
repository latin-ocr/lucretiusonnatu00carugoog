150 *Lucuanus nona

exceeding celerity: so great is the velocity, so great
the store of things; so great in any one unit of time
that sense can seize is the store of particles, out oi
which the supply may go on. .

And here many questions present themselves and

many points must be cleared up by us, if we desire to
give a plain exposition oi things The first question
is why, when the wish has occurred to any one to
think oi a thing, his mind on the instant thinks os
that very thing. Do idols observe our will, and so
soon as we will does an image present itseif to us, il
sea, is earth, ay or heaven is what we wish? Assem·
blies os mena procession, feasts, battles, everything
in short does nature at command produce and
provide? and though to increase the marvel the
mind of others in the same spot and room is thinking
of things all quite different What again are we to
say, when we see in sleep idols advance in measured
tread and move their pliant limbs‚ when in nimble
wise they put out each pliant arm in turn and repre·
sent to the eyes over and over again an action with
soot that moves in time? Idols to wit are imbued
with art and move about well-trained, to be able in
the night-time to exhibit such plays. Or will this
rather be the truth? because in one unit οἱ time,
when we can perceive it by sense and while one single
word is uttered, many latent times are contained
which reason finds to exist, therefore in any time you
please all the several idols are at hand ready prepared
in each several place. And because they are so thiu,
the mind can see distinctly only those which it strains
itself to see 3 therefore all that there are besides
are lost, save only those sor which it has made
