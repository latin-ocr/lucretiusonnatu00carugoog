350-404] LUCRETIUS 235

This is the way to see into the true nature ol the
thunderbolt and to understand by what force it
produces each effect, and not the turning over the
scrolls of Tyrrhene charms and vainly searching sor
tokens of the hidden will os the gods, in order to
know from what quarter the volant fire has come
or to which of the two halves it has betaken itself,
in what way it has gained an entrance within walled
places, and how alter lording it with tyrant sway it
has gotten itself out from these ; also what harm the
thunderstroke from heaven can do. But if Jupiter
and other gods shalre with an appalling crash the
glittering quarters of heaven, and hurl their fire
whither each is so minded, why strike they not
those whoever they be who have recked not of com·
mitting some abominable sin and make them give
forth the flames os lightning from breast pierced
through and througha sharp lesson to men? and
why rather is he whose conscience is burdened with
no foul offence, innocent though he be, wrapped and
enveloped in the flames, in a moment caught up by
the whirlwind and fire ol heaven? Why too aim
they at solitary spots and spend their labour in
vain? or are they then practising their arms and
strengthening their sinews? and why do they suffer
the father's bolt to be blunted on the earth? why
does he allow it himself, and not spare it for his
enemies? Why again, when heaven is unclouded¹
on all sides, does Jupiter never hurl a bolt on the ἵ
earth or send abroad his clapsi or does he, so soon

as clouds have spread under, then go down in person ,
into thern, that from them he may aim the strokes
of his bolt near at hand? Ay and lor what reason!
