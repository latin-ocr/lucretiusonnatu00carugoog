this sense exists in us by the agency oi the soul ; and
when sleep obstructs the action of this sense, then we
must assume that our soul has been disordered and ’
forced abroad; not indeed all; for then the body
would lie steeped in the everlasting chill of death.
Where no partos the soul remained behind concealed
in the limbs‚ as fire remains concealed when buried
under much ash, whence could sense be suddenly
rekindled through the limbs‚ as flame can spring up
from hidden fite? ·

But by what means this change of condition is
accomplished and from what the soul can be dis-
ordered and the body grow laint, 1 will explain: do
you mind that Ι waste not my words on the wind.

In the first place the body in its outer side, since it is
next to and is touched by the air, must be thumped

and beaten by its repeated blows3 and lor this reason

all things as a rule are covered either bya hide or

else by shells or by a callous skin or by barlc When
creatures breathe, this air at the same time buffets

the inner side also, as it is inhaled and exhaled.
Therelore since the body is beaten on both sidesi ·
alike and blows arrive by means of the small aper· ·.
tures at the primal parts and primal elements oi our j π
body, there gradually ensues a sort of breaking up
throughout our limbs‚ the arrangements of the first· of
beginnings of body and mind getting disordered. Qu*
Then next a part oi the soul is forced out and a .

part withdraws into the inner recesses; a part too ω
scattered about through the frame cannot get united
together and so act and be acted upon by motion; ¹
