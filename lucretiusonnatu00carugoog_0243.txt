as ever clouds begin to pass below the sun and to ,
break off so to say the rays os light, forthwith their
lower part is wholly lost, and the earth is over-

you may know that things constantly require new
irradiation and that all the preceding emissions of'
light are lost, and in no other way can things be seen
in the sun, unless the fountain head ol light itsels

which belong to earth, such as hanging lamps and
torches bright with darting flames, hasten in like
sashion amid great darkness with ministering heat to
supply new light; are eager to bicker with fires, ay
eager3 nor is the light ever broken off nor does *it
quit the spots illuminated: with such suddenness is
its destruction concealed by the swift birth of flame
from all the fires at once. In the sarne way then
we must believe that sun moon and stars emit light
from fresh and ever fresh supplies rising up, and
always lose every previous discharge of flames; that
you rnay not haply believe that these flourish

away, that shrines and idols oi gods are worn outwith
