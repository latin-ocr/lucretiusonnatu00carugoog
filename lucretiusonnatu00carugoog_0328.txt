thunderbolt have fallen exactly on the first bodies
of these things, at the points where they are inter-
twined and held together. Again it easily melts
brass and fuses gold in an instant, because its force
is formed of bodies minutely small and oi smooth
elements‚ which easily make their way in and when
they are in, in a moment break up all the knots and
untie the bonds of union. And more especially in
autumn the mansion of heaven studded with glitter·
ing stars and the whole earth are shaken on all sides,
and also when the flowery season oi spring discloses
itself. For during the cold fires are wanting and
winds fail during the heat, and the clouds then are
not of so dense a body. When therefore the seasons
of heaven are between the two extremes, the different
causes of thunder and lightning all combine3 for the
very cross-current of the year mixes up cold and
heat, both of which a cloud needs for forging thunder-
bolts; so that there is great diseord in things and
the air raving with fires and winds heaves in mighty
disorder. The first part of heat and the last of
cold is the spring-time3 therefore unlike things must
battle with one another and be turbulent when mixed
together. And when the last heat mixed with the
first cold rolls on its course, a time which goes by
the name of autumn, then too fierce winters are in
conflict with summers. Therefore these seasons are
to be called the cross-seas of the year3 and it is not
wonderful that in that season thunderbolts are most
frequent and troublous storms are stirred up in
heaven ; since both sides then engage in the troublous
medley of dubious war, the one armed with flames,
the other with winds and water commingled.
