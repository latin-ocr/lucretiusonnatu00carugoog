146 ⁸ LUCRETIUS [uoox'w

ἰ caseos those to whom the same thing is bitter within, ·
,ἰ rough and barbed seeds sure enough pass down the
't throat It rs easy now from these principles to

· understand all particular cases. thus when a sever ⁶
² has attacked any one from too great a flow oi bile,
or a violent disease has been excited rn any other
way, thereupon the whole body is disordered and at
the arrangements of particles then and there changed;
the consequence of which is that the bodies which

before were suited to excite sensatim, suit no more 3 ·
and those fit it better, which are able to make their
way in and beget a bitter sense Both kinds for

instance are mixed up in the flavour of honeyta
point we have often proved before.
Now mark me, and I will discuss the way in

which the contactos smell affects the bostrils: and
first there must be many things from which a varied
flow oi smells streams and rolls on; and we must
suppose that they thus stream and discharge and
disperse themselves among all things alike; but one
smell fits itself better to one creature, another to
another on account oi their unlike shapes; and there.
⁴ fore bees are drawn on by the smell of honey through
the air to avery great distance, and so are vultures
by carcases. Also the onward·reaching power oi
, scent in dogs leads them whithersoever the clowen
hoof of wild beasts has carried them in their
course; and the smell of man is felt sar away by the
saviour oi the Romans' citadel‚ the bright white
goose. Thus different scents assigned to different
creatures led each to its appropriate food and oon·
strain' them to recoil from nauseous poison, and in
this way the taces oi beasts are preserved.
