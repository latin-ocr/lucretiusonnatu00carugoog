1119-1174] LUCRETIUS 81

In this way then the walls too 01 the great world ᾗ
around shall be stormed and 1311 10 decay and ἒ ⁴—
crurnbling tuin Yes and even now the age is
enleebled and the earth exhaustcd by bearing scarce
produces little living creatures, she who produced all
races and gave birth to the huge bodies 01 wild
beasts. For methinks no golden chain let down to
earth from heaven above the races 01 mortal beings,
nor did the sea and waves which lash the rocks
produce thern, but the same earth bare thern which
now ieeds thern out 01 herself. Moreover she first
spontaneously 01 herself produced for mortals goodly
corn-crops and joyous vineyards ; os herself gave
sweet fruits 3ηά glad pastures; which now-a-days
scarce attain any size'when furthered by our labour:
· we exhaust the oxen and the strength 01 the husband-
rnen; we wear out our iron, scarcely sed 31131 311 by
the tilled fields ; so niggardly are they 01 their produce
, 3ηά after so much labour do they let it grow. And
now the aged ploughman shakcs his head and sighs
again 3ηά again to think that the labours 01 his
hands have corneto nothing ; and when he compares
present times with times past, he often praises the
fortunes 01 his sire and harps on the theme, how the
rnen 01 old rich in piety confortably supported 1113
on a scanty plot 01 ground, since the allotment 01
13ηά 10 each man was far less 01 yore than now.
The sorrowful planter too 01 the exhausted and
shrivelled vine impeaches the march 01 time and
wearies heaven, and comprehends not that all things -
are gradually wasting away and passing 10 the grave,
“quite forspent by age and length of days.
