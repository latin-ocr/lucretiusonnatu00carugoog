with dewy tears face and cheeks and have the
cunning to say much about the composition of things
and to enquire next what their own first-beginnings
are; since like in their natures to the entire mortals
they must in their turn be formed out of other
elements, then those others out of others, so that you
can venture nowhere to corneto a stop: yes‚ what· ’
ever you shall say speaks and laughs and thinks, I
will press you with the argument that it is formed
of other things performing these same acts. But if
we see these notions to be sheer folly and madness,
and a man may laugh though not made of laughing
things, and think and reason in learned language
though not formed of thoughtful and eloquent seeds,
why cannot the things which we see to have sense,
just as well be made up of a mixture of things
altogether devoid of sense?

Again we are all sprung from a heavenly seed, all
bave that same father, by whom mother earth the
givet of increase, when she has taken in from him
liquid drops of moisture, conceives and bears goodly
crops and joyous trees and the race of man, bears all
kinds of brute beasts, in that she supplies food with
which all feed their bodies and lead a pleasant life
and continue their race; wherefore with good cause
she has gotten the name of mother. That also which
before was from the earth, passes back into the earth,
and that which was sent from the borders of ether, is
carried back and taken in again by the quarters o
heaven. Death does not extinguish things in suc
a way as to destroy the bodies of matter, but onl ‹ 1
