to be begotten irorn vthings and to go back into ·
things, since it is a fact that all things constantly ebb. l

Likewise the abundant source of clear light, the .
ethereal sun, constantly floods heaven with fresh
brightness and supplies the place 01 light on the
instant by new light; for every previous emission 01
brightness is v quite lost to it, wherever it falls. This
you may know from the following examples: as soon
as ever clouds begin to pass below the sun and to ,
break 011 so to say the rays of light, forthwith their
lower part is wholly lost, and the earth is over·
shadowed wherever the clouds pass over; so that
you may know that things constantly require new
irradiation and that all the preceding emissions 01 “
light are lost, and in no other way can things be seen
in the sun, unless the fountain head 01 light itself
send a supply. Moreoven, you see, nightly lights
which belong to earth, such as hanging lamps and
torches bright with darting flames, hasten in like
fashion amid great darkness with ministering heat to
supply new light; are eager to bicker with fires, ay
eager; nor is the light ever broken off nor does *it
quit the spots illuminated: with such suddenness is¹
its destruction concealed by the swift birth 01 flame
from 311 the fires at once In the sarne way then ,
we must believe that sun moon and stars emit light
from fresh and ever fresh supplies rising up, and
always lose every previous discharge 01 flames3 that
you may not haply believe that these flourish
indestructible.

Again see you not that even stones are conquered
by time, that high towers fall and rocks moulder .
away, that shrines and idols of gods are worn outwuin
