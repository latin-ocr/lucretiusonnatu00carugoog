films which calves at their birth cast from the surface

’ of their body, as well as the vesture which the
slippery serpent puts off among the thorns ; for often
we see the brambles enriched with their flying spoils:
since these cases occur, a thin image likewise must be
emitted from things off their surface. For why those
films should drop off and withdraw from things
rather than films which are really thiu, not one tittle ’
of proof can be given; especially since there are on
the surface of things many minute bodies which may
be dischggfflnrhesamenrderrheyhadheforeand
preserve the 0⁰t¹il¹39Ql÷²Pe2 and be discharged
wit ar more velocity, inasmuch as they are less
liable to get hampered being few in number and
stationed in the front rank. For without doubt we
see many things discharge and freely give not only
from the core and centre, as we said before, but from
their surfaces, besides other things,cQ itself. And
this is commonly done by yellow and red and dark- >
blue awnin gs, when they are spread over large theatres
and flutter and wave as they stretch across their poles
and crossbeams; for then they dye the seated assem-
blage below and all the show of the stage and the
richly attired company of the fathers, and compel them
to dance about in their colour. And the more these ι
obj ects are shut in all round by the walls of the theatre
the more do all of them within laugh on all hands,
o’erlaid with graceful hues, the light of day being,
narrowed. Therefore since sheets of canvass emit
colour from their surface, all things will naturally
emit thin pictures tou, since in each case alike they
discharge from the surface. There are therefore as ι

now shewn sure outlines of shapes, which hy all about!
