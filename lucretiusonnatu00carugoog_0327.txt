in motion first in all cases collects itsell in the clouds
and gathers itself up sor a great effort at starting3
then when the cloud is no longer able to hold the
increased moving power, their force is pressed out
and therefore flies with a marvellous moving power,
like to that with which missiles are carried when
discharged from poweriul engines. Then too the
thunderbolt consists of small and smooth elements‚
and such a nature it is not easy ior anything to
withstand ; for it flies between and passes in through
the porons passages; therefore it is not ehecked and
delayed by many collisions, and lor this reason it
glides and flies on with a swist moving power. Next,
all weights without exception naturally pressing down-
ward, when to this a blow is added, the velocity is
doubled and yon moving power becomes so intense
that the thunderbolt dashes aside more impetuously
and swiftly whatever gets in its way and tries to
hinder it, and pursues its journey. Then too as it
advances with a long-continued moving power, it
must again and again receive new velocity which ever
increases as it goes on and augments its powerlul
might and gives vigour to its stroke ; for it forces
all the seeds os the thunder to be borne right onward
to one spot so to speak, throwing them all together,
as on they roll, into that single line. Perhaps too
as it goes on it attracts certain bodies out of the
air itself, and these by their blows kindle apace
its velocity. It passes too through things without
injuring them, and leaves many things quite whole
