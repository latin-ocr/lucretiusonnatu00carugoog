through the length and breadth of heaven, fly over ι
sea and lands and flood the heaven, what then of
those which stand ready posted in front rank, when
’ they are discharged and nothing obstructs their
egress? how much faster, you see, and farther must
they travel, scouring through many times the same
amount of space in the same time that the sunlight
takes to spread over heaven! This too appears to be
an eminently- true proos os the velocity with which
idols of things are borne along: as soon as ever the
brightness os water is set down in the open air, il the
heaven is starry, in a moment the clear radiant con-
stellations ol ether imaged in the water correspond to
those in the heaven. Now do you see in what a
moment oi time an image drops down from the
borders of heaven to the borders os earth? Therelore
again and again I repeat you must admit that bodies
capable of striking the eyes and of provoking vision
[constantly travel] with a marvellous [velocity].
Smells too incessantly stream from certain things;
as does cold from riverS, heat from the sun, spray
from the waves ,of the sea, that enter into walls near
the shore Various sounds also cease not to fly
through the air. Thcn too a moist salt flavour often
comes into the mouth, when we are moving about
beside the sea; and when we look‘ on at the mixing
of a decoction of wormwood, its bitterness affects us,
In such a constant stream from all things the several
qualities are carried and are transmitted in all direc-
tions round, and no delay, no respite in the flow is ever
granted, since we constantly have feeling, and may at
any time see smell and hear the sound ol anything.
Again since a particular figure felt by the hands
