319-378] LUCRETIUS 13‘5

conversely in the dark out of the light, because the
grosser air of darkness follows behind and quite fills
all the openings and blocks up the passages of the
eyes, not letting the idols of any things at ailbe
thrown into the eyes to move thern. Again when
we descry far off the square towers of a town, they
often appear to be round for this reason: all the
angles are seen from a distance to look obtuse, or
rather are not seen at all, and their blow is lost and
their stroke never makes its way to our sight, because
while the idols are borne on through much air, the
air by repeated collisione blunts the stroke perforce.
When in this way all the angles have together eluded
the sense, the stone structures are rounded off as if
by the lathe3 yet they do not look like the things
which are close before us and really round, but some-
what resembling them as in shadowy outIIne. Our
shadow likewise seems to move in the sunshine and
to follow our steps and mimic our action; if you
think forsooth that air deprived of life can step,'
imitating the motions and the actions of men; for
that which we are wont to term shadow can be
nothing but air devoid of light. Sure enough
because the earth in certain spots successively is
deprived of light wherever we intercept it in moving
about, while that part of it which we have quitted is
filled with light, therefore that which was the shadow
of our body, seems to have always followed us un-
changed in a direct line with us. For new rays of
light ever pour in and the old are lost, just as if wool
were drawn into the fire. T herefore the earth is
readily stripped of light, and again filled, and
cleanses itself from black shadows
