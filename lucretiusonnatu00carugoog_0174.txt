through the length and breadth of heaven, fly over

sea and lands and flood the heaven, what then of ⁴
those which stand ready posted in front rank, when
they are discharged and nothing obstructs their
egressi how much fastor, you see, and farthcr must
they travel, scouring through many times the same
amount of space in the same time that the sunlight
takes to spread over heaven! This too appears to be
an eminently- true prooi os the velocity with which
idols oi things are borne along: as soon as ever the
brightness os water isset down in the open air, ii the
heaven is stany, in a moment the clear radiant con-
stellations os ether imaged in the water correspond to
those in the heaven. Now do you see in what a
moment oi time an image drops down from the
borders of heaven to the borders oi earth? Theresore
again and again 1 repeat you must admit that bodies
capable oi striking the eyes and os provoking vision
[constantly travel] with a marvellous [velocity].
Smells too incessantly stream from certain things ;
as does cold srom rivers, heat from the sun, spray
from the waves ‚os the sea, that enter into walls near
the shore Various sounds also cease not to fly
through the air. Then too a moist salt flavour often
comes into the mouth, when we are moving about
beside the sea3 and when we look· on at the rnixing
os a decoction os wormwood, its bitterness affects us.
In such a constant stream irorn all things the several
qualities are carried and are transmitted in all direc-
tions round, and no delay, no respite in the flow is ever
granted, since we constantly have feeling, and may at
any time see smeil and hear the sound oi anything.
