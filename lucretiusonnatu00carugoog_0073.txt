' But if haply any one believes that heavier bodies,
as they are carried more quickly sheer through space,
can sall from above on the lighter and so beget blows
able to produce begetting motions, he goes most
widely astray from true reason. For whenever
bodies fall through water and thin alr, they must ξ
quicken their descents in proportion to their weights, ²
because the body ol water and subtle nature os air Δ
cannot retard everything in equal degree, but more
readily give way, overpowered by the heavier: on
the other hand empty void cannot offer resistance to ,¹
anything in any direction at any time, but'inust, as
its nature craves, continually give way; and for this

For this ,we see to be plain and evident, that weights,

they fall from above, at least so lar as you can

the straight course, who is there that can perceive?
