252 LUCRETIUS [Boou v1

night-time. This sountain men marvel at exceed-
ingly and suppose that it suddenly becomes hot by
the influence 01 the fierce sun below the earth, when
night has covered the earth with awful darkness.
But this is 131 131 removed from true reason. Why
when the sun though in contact with the uncovered
body 01 the water has not been able to make it hot
on its upper side, though his light above possesses
such great heat, how can he below the earth which is
01 30 dense a body boil the water and glut it with
heat? above all when he can scarcely with his burn·
ing rays force his heat through the walls 01 houses.
What then is the cause? this sure enough: the earth
is more porous and warmer round the sountain than
the rest 01 the earth, and there are many seeds 01 fire
near the body 01 water. For this reason when night
has buried the earth in its dewy shadows, the earth
at once becomes quite cold and contracts: in this
way just as ii it were squeezed by the hand it forces
out into the iountain whatever seeds 01 fire it has;
and these make the water hot to the touch and taste.
Next when the sun has risen and with his rays has
loosened the earth and has rarefied it as his heat
waxes stronger, the first-beginnings 01 lire return
back to their ancient seats and all the heat 01 the
water withdraws into the earth: 101 this reason the
sountain becomes cold in the daylight. Again the
liquid 01 water is played upon by the sun’s rays and
in the daytime is rarefied by his throbbing heat;
and therefore it gives up whatever seeds 01 fire
it has ; just as it often parts with the 11031 which

bt hglds in itseli, and thaws the ice and loosens its
on 3.
