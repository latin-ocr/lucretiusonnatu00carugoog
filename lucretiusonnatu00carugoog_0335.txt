And with good cause, since buildings beside a road
tremble throughout when shaken by a waggon os not ,

of the wheels on both sides. Sometimes too, when
an enormous mass of soil through age rolls down
from the land into great and extensive pools of ⁴
water, the earth rocks and sways with the undulationv

winds did not abate their blowing, no force could
rein things in or hold them up on their road to
destruction. As it is, because by tums they do
abate and then increase in violence, and so to speak
rally and return to the charge, and then are deieated
