four, if not six, commas in that sentence, and that
most readers would be grateful for them. Nor would
FitzGerald have liked “the birth-favouring breeze of

of punctuation became more like that of other people.

It must not be supposed that Munro said the last
word on the poem of Lucretius: it takes long to
exhaust the significance of such a monument of human
genius Much has since been done, both for the criti·
cism and explanation of the poem, especially by Carlo
Giussani, an Italian scholar, whose name will rank
with those of Lachmann, Bemays, and Munro. Yet
Munro's edition and, still more, his translation, are
not superseded, and it is probable that they never can
be. For power of thought united with power of style
will secure the permanence of his work.

probable that he took no partin public affairs and
