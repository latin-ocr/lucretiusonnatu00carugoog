through the length and breadth ol heaven, ily over
sea and lands and llood the heaven, what then of

, those which stand ready posted in iront rank, when
’ they are discharged and nothing obstructs their

egress? how much iaster, you see, and sarther must
they travel, scouring through many times the same
amount oi space in the same time that the sunlight
takes to spread over heaven! This too appears to be

idols os things are borne along: as soon as ever the
brightness oi water is set down ln the open air, ii the
heaven is starry, in a moment the clear radiant con-
stellations ol ether imaged in the water correspond to
those in the heaven. Now do you see in whata
moment oi time an image drops down from the
borders oi heaven to the borders of earth? Thereiore
again and again 1 repeat you must admit that bodies
capable of striking the eyes and oi provokiug vision
[constantly travel] with a marvellous [velocity].

as does cold from rivers, heat irom the sun, spray
from the naves ,os thesea, that enter into walls near
the shore Various sounds also cease not to fly
through the air. Then too a moist salt flavour often
comes into the mouth, when we are moving about
beside the sea; aud when we look· on at the mixing
os a decoction oi wormwood, its bitterness affects us.
In such a constant stream from all things the several
qualities are carried and are transmitted in all direc-
tions round, and no delay, no respite in the flow is ever
granted, since we constantly have feeling, and may at
any time see smell and hear the sound of anything.
Again since a particular figure felt by the hands
