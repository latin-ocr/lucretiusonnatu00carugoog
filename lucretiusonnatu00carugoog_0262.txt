mark the proofs: first of all some portion of the
earth, burnt up by constant suns, trampled by a
multitude of feet, sends forth a cloud and flying
eddies of dust, which the strong winds disperse over
the whole air. Part too of the soil is put under
water by, rains, and rivers graze against and eat into
, the banks. Again whatever increases something else,
is in its turn replenished; and since beyond a doubt
earth the universal mother is found at the same time
to be the general tomb of things, therefore you see
she is lessened and increases and grows again.
Furthermore, that sea rivers fountains always
stream over with new moisture and that waters well
up without ceasing, it needs no words to prove: the
great flow of waters from all sides clearly shews it.
But then the water on the surface is always taken
off, and thus it is that on the whole there is no
overflow, partly because the seas are lessened by the
strong winds sweeping over them and by the ethereal
sun decomposing thern with his rays; partly, because
the water is diffused below the suriace over all lands;
for the salt is strained off and the matter of liquid
streams back again to the source and all meets
together at the river-heads, and then flows over the
lands in a fresh current, where a channel once scooped
out has carried down the waters with liquid foot.
And next 1 will speak of the air which is changed
over its whole body every honr in countless ways.
For whatever ebbs from things, is all borne always
into the great sea of air 3 and unless itin return were
to give back bodies to things and to recruit them as
they ebb, all things ere now would have been dis-
solved and changed into air. It therefore ceases not
