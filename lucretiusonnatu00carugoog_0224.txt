exceeding celerity: so great is the velocity, so great
the store ol things, so great in any one unit of time
that sense can seize is the store of particles, out ol
which the supply may go on. .

And here many questions present themselves and

many points must be cleared up by us, il we desire to
give a plain exposition of things. The first question
is why, when the wish has occurred to any one to
think os a thing, his mind on the instant thinks of
that very thing. Do idols observe our will, 3ηά so
soon as we will does an image present itself to us, il
sea, ir earth, ay or heaven is what we wish? Assem-
blies os men, a procession, feasts, battles, everything
in short does nature at command produce and
provide? 3ηά though to increase the marvel the
mind of others in the same spot and room is thinking
os things 311 quite different. What again are we to
say, when we see in sleep idols advance in measured
tread and move their pliant limbs, when in nimble
wise they put out each pliant arm in turn and repre-
sent to the eyes over 3ηά over again an action with
ioot that moves in time? Idols to wit are imbued
with art and move about well-trained, to be able in
the night-time to exhibit such plays. Or will this
rather be the truth? because in one unit os time,
when we can perceive it by sense and while one single
word is uttered, many latent times are contained'
which reason finds to exist, therefore in any time you
ἢ please all the several idols are at hand ready prepared
’J' in each several place. And because they are so thin,
k, the mind can see distinctly only those which it strains
:J itself to see3 therefore all that there are besides
' are lost, save only those lor which it has made
