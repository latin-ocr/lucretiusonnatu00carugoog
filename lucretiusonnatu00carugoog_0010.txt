edition ol Lucretius ; but his first published work
was a paper on Aristotle's “Inductive Logic‚’' read
before the Philosophical Society on February 11, 1850.
The paper is characteristic ol Munr0: when he had
once maturely considered a problem and reached a
conclusion conceming it, he would state his view with
uncompromising force and directness, however im-
posing and distinguished were the authorities opposed
to him. In the present case Dr. Whewell, the distin·
’ guished and omniscient master os his own College‚ had
put lorward certain views on Aristotle's “ Logic‚” and,
in order to support them, had proposed an emenda-
tion os the text Munro calmly replied that, il all the
MSS. of Aristotle offered the text proposed by the ’
master, he would without hesitation emend the text
so as to run as it now does It is likely that Whewell
was somewhat taken aback by criticism so srank; but
he was a magnanimous man and able to appreciate
force os character even in the junior Fellows of his
College. Munro’s next publication dealt with a Latin
inscription of 270 B.c., and contains a long and in·
teresting discussion of accent and quantity in ancient
an'd modern poetry. From first to last he was deeply
interested in rhythm and metre; and his knowledge
and skill in these matters stood him in good stead
when he came to deal with the textos Latin poets.
When he took a solitary walk or suffered from sleep-
lessness at night, he osten turned some piece of
modern poetry, with which his memory was well
stored, into Greek or Latin verse. These transla-
tions he would sometimes commit to writing at
college meetings which he was obliged to attend, as
one of the eight Senior Fellows who then governed
the College, though the business was not always such
