kind, they must sure enough have a body of un-
changeable matter also. Foris the first-beginnings
of things could in any way be vanquished and changed,

it would then be uncertain too what could and what
could not rise into being, in short on what principle
each thing has its powers defined,itsdeep-set boundary
mark; nor could the generations reproduce so often
each alter its kind the nature habits, way of life and '
motions ol the parents.

Then again since there is ever a bounding point
[to bodies, which appears to us to be a least, there
ought in the same way to bea bounding point the ¹
least conceivable] to that first body which already is
beyond what our senses can perceive ε that point sure
enough is without parts and consists os a least nature
and never has existed apart by itself and will not be
able in future so to exist, since it isin itself a part ol
that other 3 and so a first and single part and then
other and other similar parts in succession fill up in
close serried mass the nature os the first body; and
since these cannot exist by themselves, they must
cleave to that from which they cannot in any way be
torn. First·beginnings therefore are ol solid single-
ness, massed together and cohering closely by means
of least parts, not compounded out of a union of
those parts, but, rather, strong in everlasting single·
ness. From them nature allows nothing to be torn,
nothing further to be worn away, reserviug them as
seeds for things. Again unless there shall be a least, t
the very smallest bodies will consist oi infinite parts, l

inasmu'ch as the half of the half will always have ahall' ξ
and nothing will set bounds to the division. lherelore h,
