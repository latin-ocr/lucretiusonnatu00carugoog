them. So universally there is found to be nothing
solid in things. But yet because true reason and the
nature of things constrains, attend until we make
· clear in a few verses that there are such things as
consist of solid and everlasting body, which we teach
are seeds of things and first-beginnings, out of which
the whole sum of things which now exists has been
produced. Ι
First of all then since there has been found to
exist a two-fuld and widely dissimilar nature of two
things that is to say of body and of place in which
things severally go on, each of the two must exist
for and by itself and quite unmixed. For wherever
h there is empty space which we call void, there body
is not; wherever again body maintains itself, there
empty void no wise exists. First bodies therefore
are solid and without void. Again since there is void
in things begotten, solid matter must exist about this
void, and no thing can be proved by true reason to
conceal in its body and have within it void, unless
you choose to allow that that which holds it in is
solid. Again that can be nothing but a union of
matter which can keep in the void of things Matter
therefore, which consists of a solid body, may be ever· .
lasting, though all things else are dissolved. Moreover
if there were no empty void, the universe would be
solid; unless on‘the other hand there were certain
bodies to fill up whatever places they occupied, the
existing universe would be empty and void space
Therefore sure enough body and void are marked off
in alternate layers, since the universe is neither of
a perfect fulness nor a perfect void. There are there·
fore certain bodies which can vary void space with
