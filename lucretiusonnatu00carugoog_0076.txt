on a green hill. Again when mighty legions fill with ·
their movements all parts of the plains waging the
mimicry oi war, the glitter then lifts itself up to the
sky, and the whole earth round gleams with brass
and beneath a noise is raised by the mighty trampling
of men and the mountains stricken hythe shouting
reecho the voices to the stars of heaven, and horse-

the middle os the plains, shaking thern with the
vehemence oi their charge. And yet there is some
spot on the high hills, seen from which they appear to
stand still and to rest on the plains as a bright spot

do not all resemble one the other. And no wonder;
ior since there is so great a store of them that, as Ι
x have shewn, there is no end or sum, they must sure
enough not one and all be marked 'by an equal bulk
