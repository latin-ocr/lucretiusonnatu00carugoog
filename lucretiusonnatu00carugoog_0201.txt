from one end to the other and stands supported by
equal columns along its whole extent, yet when from
the top of it it is seen in its entire length, it gradually
forms the contracted top ol a narrowing cone, until
uniting roos with floor and all the right side with the
lest it has brought thern together into the vanishing
point of a cone. To sailors on the sea the sun
appears to rise out of the waters and in the waters to
set and bury his light ; just because they behold
nothing but water and sky, that you may uothossnth*
