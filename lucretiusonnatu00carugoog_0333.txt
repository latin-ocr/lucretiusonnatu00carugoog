tel-us] LUCRETIUS 239

in a short time cover over with such great mountains
os clouds scas and lands‚ as they hang down upon
them overhead‚ since on all sides through all the
cavities os ether and as it were through the vents
of the great world around the power oi going out
and coming in is accorded to the elements.

Now mark and 1 will explain in what way‘the
rainy moisture is formed in the clouds above and
then is sent down and ialls to the earth in the shape
oi rain. And first 1 will prove that many seeds os
water rise up together with the clouds themselves out
os all things and that both the clouds and the water
which is in the clouds thus increase together; just as
our body increases together with the blood, as well
as the sweat and all the moisture which is in the
srame. The clouds likewise imbibe much sea-water
as well, like hanging fleeces of wool, when the winds
cmmwmmmhfflmm
moisture is taken up out os all rivers into the clouds ;
and when the seeds os waters full many in number in
many ways have met in them, augmented from all
sides, then the close-packed clouds endeavour to dis-
charge their moisture from two causes: the force oi
the wind drives them together, and likewise the very
abundance oi the rain-clouds, when a greater mass
than usual has been brought together, pushes down,
presses from above and forces the rain to stream out.
Again when the clouds are also rarefied by the winds,
or are dispersed‚ being smitten at the same time by
the heat oi the sun, they discharge a rainy moisture
and trickle down, just as wax over a hot fire melts
away and turns fast into liquid. But a violent rain

follows, when the clouds are violently oressed onon
