it in at both ends ; and then that a third air streams
above and moves in the same direction in which roll

else that this third air streams below in order to carry
up the sphere in the contrary direction; just as we
see rivers turn wheels and water-scoops. It is like·
vise quite possible too that all the heaven remains at
rest, while at the same time the glittering signs are
carried on; either because rapid heats ol ether are
shut in and whirl round while secking a way out and
roll their fires in all directions through heaven's
Summanian quarters3 or else an air streaming from
some part from another source outside drives and
whirls the fires; or else they may glide on of them-
selves going whithersoever the iood oi each calls and
invites them, leeding their flamy bodies everywhere
throughout heaven. For which oi ¹ these causes isin ’
operation in this world, it is not easy to affirm ior
certain ; but what can be and is done throughout the
universe in various worlds formed on various plans,

which may exist throughout the universe sor the
motions os stars; one oi which however must in this
world also be the cause that imparts lively motionflto
the-'signs3 but to dictate which of them it is, is by no
means the duty oi the man:who advances step by step.

And in order that the earth may rest in the
middle os the world, it is proper that its weight
should gradually pass away and be lessened‚ and
that it should have another nature underneath it

conjoined from the beginning of its existence and ’

formed into one being with the airy portioris ol ὼε
