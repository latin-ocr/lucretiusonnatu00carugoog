bones and sinews within the body, 11 11 (1033 301 take
life, yet there ensues a saintness and a lazy sinking to
the ground and on the ground the turmoil 01 mind
which arises, and sometimes a kind 01 undecided ”
inclination to get up. Therefore the nature 01 the
mind must be bodily, since it suffers 11013 bodily
weapons and blows. ,¹
1 will now go on to explain in my verses of what
kind 01 body the mind consists and out 01 what it is

and formed 01 exceedingly minute bodies. That this
isso you may, 11 you please to attend, clearly perceive
from what follows: nothing that is seen takes place
with a velocity equal to that 01 the mind when it
starts some suggestion and actually sets it agoing;
the mind thereifflffld ,111111 greater rapidity
than any 01 the things whose nature stands out visible
to sight But that which rs so passing nimble, must

minute, in order to be stirred and setin motion by
a small moving power. Thus water is moved and
heaves by ever so small a 10133, formed as itis 01
313311 1131113133 apt to roll. But on the other hand
the nature 01 honey is more sticky, its liquid more
sluggish and its movement more dilatory; for the
whole mass 01 3131131 coheres more closely, because
sure enough it is made 01 bodies not so smooth fine
and round. A breeze however gentle and light can
force, as you may see, a high heap 01 poppy seed 10
be blown away from the top downwards; buton the
other hand eurus itself cannot move 3 heap 01 310333.
