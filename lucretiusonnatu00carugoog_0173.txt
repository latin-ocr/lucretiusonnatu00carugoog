can tell how small a fraction oi these an image is, or
express that sum in language ’ ⁴
Now mark: how swist the motion is with which

idols are borne along, and what velocity is assigned
to them as they glide through the air, so that but a
short hour is spent on a journey through long space,
whatever the spot towards which they go with a
movement os varied tendency, all this I will tell in
sweetly worded rather than in many verses ; as the·
short song of the swan is better than the loud noise

the south First of all we may very often observe¹

' that things which are light and madeus minute bodies ¹
are swist. of this kind are the light of the sun and ’
its heat, because they are made of minute first things ’
which are knocked forward so to speak and do not “
hesitate to pass through the space os air between,
ever driven on by a blow following behind ; lor light
on the instant is supplied by fresh light and brightness
goaded to shew its brightness in what you might call
an ever on-moving team. Theresore in like manner
idols must be able to scour in a moment os time
through space unspeakable, first because they are¹
exceeding small and there is a cause at their back to}
carry and impel them far forward; where moreover'
they move on with such winged lightness; next?
because when emitted they are possessed of so rarel .
a texture, that they can readily pass through any}
things and stream as it were through the space ol air¹¹
between. Again ir those minute bodies of things
which are given out from the inmost depths of these
things, as the light and heat of the sun, are seen

in a moment of time to glide and spread themsekuee
