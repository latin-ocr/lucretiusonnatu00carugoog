perceive to have sense, you must yet admit·
all composed of senseless first-beginnings: man'ite‘
tolrens which are open to all to apprehend, so far
from refuting or contradicting this, do rather them-
selves talre us by the hand and constrain us to believe
that, as I say, living things are begotten from sense-
less things. We may see in lact living worms spring
out os stinking dung, when the soaked earth has
gotten putridity aster excessive rains; and all things
besides change in the same way: rivers leaves and

’ glad pastures change into cattle, cattle change their
substance into our bodies, and often out ol these the
powers os wild beasts and the bodies os the strong of
wing are increased. Therelore nature changes all
foods into living bodies and engenders out of thern
all the senses of living creatures‚ much in the same
way as she dissolves dry woods into flames and con·
verts all things into fires. Now do you see that it is ·
of great moment in what sort os arrangement the
first-beginnings os things are severally placed and&
with what others they are mixed up, when they js
impart and receive motions? '

Then again what is that which strikes your mind,

affects that mind and constrains it to give utterance
to many different thoughts, to save you from believ-
ing that the sensible is begotten out os senseless
things? Sure enough it is because stones and wood
and earth however mixed together are yet unable to
produce vital sense. This therefore it will be well to
remember herein, that l do not assert that the sen·
sible and sensations are sorthwith begotten out ol all
elements without exception which produce things3 l
but that it is os great moment hrst bow nimute ue
