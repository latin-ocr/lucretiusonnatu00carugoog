to be to our senses. For from whatever distances ᾖ
lires can reach us with their light and breathe on our
limbs burning heat, those distances take away nothing “
by such spaces between srorn the body ol the flames,
the fire is not in the least narrowed in appearance.
Theresore since the heat of the sun aud the light
which it sheds reach our senses and stroke the proper
places, the form too and size of the sun must be seen
from this earth in their real dimensious, so that you
may not add anything whatever more or less. And l
whether the moon as it is borne on illuminates places

” with a borrowed light, or emits its own light from its
own body, whatever that is, the lorm with which it is ξ
thus borne on is not at all larger than the one which T>
it presents to our eyes seems to us to be. For all
things which we see at a great distance through much
air, look dimmed in appearance before their size is
diminished. Theresore since the 'moon presents a
bright aspect and well-defined form, it must be seen
on high by us from this earth precisely such as it is in
the outline which defines it, and os the size it actually ·
is. Lastly in the case ol all those fires ol ether which
you observe from this earth—since in the case os fires
which we see here on earth, so long as their flickering
is distinct, so long as their heat is perceived‚ their
'size is seen sometimes to change to a very very small
extent either way, according to the distance at which

l they are—you may inser that the lires of ether may be
smaller than they look in an extremely minute degree,
or larger by a very'small and insignificant fraction. ,ἡ

’ This likewise need not excite wonder, how it is ‘¹⁸⁹'
that so small a body as yon sun can emit so great a up
light, enough to flood completely seas and all Ἀώς
