that hollow clouds have very many seeds of heat, and
they must also take many in from the sun’s rays and
their heat. On this account when the same wind
which happens to collect them into any one place,
has forced out many seeds of heat and has mixed
itself up with that fire, then the eddy of wind forces
away in and -whirls about in the straitened room and
points the thunderbolt in the fiery fumaces within 3
for it is kindled in two ways at once: it is heated by
its own velocity and from the contact of fire. After
that when the force of the wind has been thoroughly

run through high heaven ; for the whole body of the
storm then without exception quakes with the shock
and loud roarings are aroused. After this shock
follows so heavy and copious a rain that the whole
ether seems to be turning into rain and then to be
tumbling down and returning to a deluge: so great
a flood of it is discharged by the bursting of the cloud
and the storm of wind, when the sound flies forth

from the buming stroke. At times too the force of Ἴ
