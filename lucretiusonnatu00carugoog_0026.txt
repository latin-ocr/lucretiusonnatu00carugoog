2 LUCRETIUS [soon 1

[s continue their races with desire Since thou then art
· sole mistress ol the nature of things and without thee
nothing rises up into the divine borders os light,
nothing grows to be glad or lovely, lain would I have

and lands; for thou alone canst bless mankind with
calm peace, seeing that Mavors lord of battle controls

himself into thy lap quite vauquished by the never-

, and shapely neck thrown back feeds with love his
greedy sight gazing, goddess, open-mouthed on thee 3
and as backward he reclines, his breath stays hanging
on thy lips. While then, lady, he is reposing on thy
holy body, shed thysell about him and above, and
pour from thy lips sweet discourse, asking‚ glorious
dame, gentle peace sor the Romans. For neither can
we in our country's day of trouble with untroublod
, mind think only of our work, nor can the illustrious
offset of Memmius in times like these be wanting to
the general weal.

sor what remains to tell, apply to true reason un-
busied ears and akeen mind withdrawn from cares,
lest my gists set out for you with steadfast zeal you '
abandon with disdain, before they are understood.
For] will essay to discourse to you os the most high
