monus] LUCRETIUS 253

There is also a cold fountain of such a nature that
tow often when held over it imbibes fire forthwith
and emits flame; a pine torch in like manner is
lighted and shines among the waters, in whatever
direction it swims under the impulse of the winds.
Because sure enough there are in the water very
many seeds of heat‚ and from the earth itself at the
bottom must rise up bodies of fire throughout the
whole sountain and at the same time pass abroad in
exhalatione and go forth into the air, not in such
numbers however that the fountain can become hot,
for these reasons a force compels those seeds to
burst out through the water and disperse abroad and
to unite when they have mounted up. In the sea at
Aradus is a fountain of this kind, which wells up with
fresh water and keeps off the salt waters all round it ;
and in many other quarters the sea affords a season-
able help in need to thirsting sailors, vomiting forth
fresh waters amid the salt. In this way then those
seeds may burst forth through that fountain and well ,
out; and when they are met together in the tow or
cohere in the body of the pine-torch, they at once ·
readily take lire, because the tow and pinewood
contain in them likewise many seeds of latent fire.
See you not too that, when you bring a newly
extinguished wick near night-lamps it catches light
before it has touched the flame; and the same with
the pinewood? And many things beside catch fire
at some distance touched merely by the heat, before
the fire in actual contact insects them. This therefore
you must suppose to take place in that fountain as
well.

N ext in order I will proceed to discuss low what
