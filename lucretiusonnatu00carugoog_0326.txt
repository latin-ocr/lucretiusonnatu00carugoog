towards which the force in question has borne down

Sometimes too the power os the wind though dis-
charged without lire, yet catches fire in the course ol
its long travel, and while it is passing on, it loses on
the way some large bodies which cannot like the rest
get through the air; and gethers together out oi the
air itsels and carries along with it other bodies ol very
small size which mix with it and produce tire by
their flight; very much in the same way as a leaden
ball becomes hot during its course, when it loses
many bodies oi cold and has taken up fire in the air.
Sometimes too the soree os the blow itsels strikes out
fire, when the force of wind discharged in a cold state
without fire has struck, because sure enough, when it
has smitten witha powerful stroke, the elements of
heat are able to stream together out of the wind
itsels and at the same time out oi the thing which
then encounters the stroke Thus, when we strike

“ a stone with iron, fire flies out3 and none the less,

because the force os the iron is cold, do its seeds oi
fiery brightness meet together upon the stroke.
Theresore in the same way too a thing ought to be
seton fire by the thunderbolt, if it has happened to
be in a state suited to receive and susceptible os the
flames. At the same time the might of the wind cannot
lightly be thought to be absolutely and decidedly
cold, seeing that it is discharged with such force from
above; but if it is not already set on lire during its
course, it yet arrives in a warm state with heat mixed
up in it

But the velocity of thunderbolts is great and their
stroke powersul, and they run through their course
with a rapid descent, because their force when set
