be an infinite supply ol matter out ol which it may be
conceived and brought into being, it cannot be pro
duced, and, more than this, it cannot have growth and
lood. For though 1 should assume this point also

mortals a waming to try to shun the snares and
violence and guile ol the faithless sea, and never at
