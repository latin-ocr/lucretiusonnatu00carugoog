tangled elements, so that they may be able to pierce
the body and enter it with biting power, yet not stick
together. thus you may easily know, that whatever
we see the senses have been able to allay, consists
not oi tangled but of pointed elements Do not
however hold it to bc wonderful that some things
which are ·fluid you sec to be likewise bitter, for
instance the sea's moisture: because it is huid, it
consists os smooth and round particles, and many ·
rough bodies mixed up with these produce pains ;
and* yet they must not be hooked so as to hold
together: you are to know that though rough, they
are yet spherical, so that while they roll freely on, ,
they may at the same time hurt the senses. And that
you may more readily believe that with smooth are '2
mixed rough first-beginnings from which Neptune’s
‘body is made bitter, there is away oi separating these,
andos seeing how the sresh water, when it is osten
filtered ¹through the earth, flows by itsels into a trench
and sweetenS, · sor it leaves· above the first-beginnings
of the nauseous saltness, inasmuch as the rough
particles can more readily stay behind m the earth
And now that 1 have shewn this, Ι will go on to
link to it a truth which depends on this and from r
this draws its proof· . the first-beginnings of things l!
have different shapes, but the number of shapes is *i
finite Il this were not so, then once more it would? ·
follow that some seeds must be os infinite bulk oin„
body. For m the same seed,' m the single small srze
of any first body you like the shapes cannot vary
much from one another. say for instance that first
bodies consist of three least parts, or augment them

by a few more ,· when to wit in all possible waysssrw
