too the baby, like to a sailor cast away by the cruel
waves, lies naked. ou the ground, speechless, wanting
every furtherancdos lise, soon as nature by the throes

of birth has shed him forth from his mother’s womb
into the borders ol light: he fills the roorn with a
rueful wauling as well he may whose destiny it is

to go through in lise so many ills. But the different Α
flocks herds and wild beasts grow up; they want no ¹
rattles; to none of them need be addressed the fond ἵ
broken accents of the fostering nurse; they ask not
different dresses according to the season; no nor

do they want arms or lofty walls, whereby to protect
their own, the earth itself and nature manisold in
her works producing in plenty all things for all.

First of all, since the body of the earth 3ηά water
3ηά the light breath of air and burning heats, out
of which this surn os things is seen to be formed, ³
do all consist ol a body that had 3 birth and is
mortal, the whole nature ol the world must be j
reckoned os a like body. For those things whose l·
parts and members we see to be ol a body that had
a birth and ol forms that are mortal‚ we perceivess
to be likewise without exception mortal, and at the '
same time to have had a birth. Since therefore 1
see that the chiefest members and parts ol the world
are destroyed and begotten anew‚ Ι may be sure that
sor heaven and earth as well there has been a time
ol beginning and there will be a time of destruction.

And herein that you may not think 1 have un·
fairly seized on this point for myself‚ because Ι have
assumed that earth and fire are mortal and bave
not doubted that water and air perish‚ and have said
that these are likewise begotten and grow alresh¹
