by mutual desire or the headstrong violence and
vehement lust os the rnan or a bribe os some acorns

[and arbute-berries or choice pears. And trusting to

the marvellous powers of their hands and feet they
would pursue the forest-haunting races os wild beasts
with showers os stones and club os ponderous weight;
and many they would conquer, a lew they would
avoid in hiding-places; and like to bristly swine just
as they were they would throw their savage limbs
all naked on the ground, when overtaken by night,
covering¹ themselves up with leaves and boughs
Yet never with loud wailings would they call sor the
daylight and the sun, wandering terror-strichen over
the fields in the shadows of night, but silent and
buried in sleep they would wait, till the sun with
rosy torch carried light into heaven; for accustorned ’
as they had been from childhood always to see dark-
ness and light begotten time about, never could any
wonder come over thern, nor any misgiving that
never-ending night would cover the earth and the
light of the sun be withdrawn for evermore. But
what gave them trouble was rather the races os wild
beasts which would osten render repose fatal to the
poor wretches. And driven from their horne they
would fly from their rocky shelters on the approach
of a foeming bear or a strong lion, and in the dead of
night they would surrender in terror to their savage
guests their sleeping·places strawn with leaves.

’ Nor then much more than now would the taces
oi mortal men leave the sweet light of ebbing lise.
For then this one or that other one ol thern would be
more likely to be seized, and torn open by their teeth
would surnish to the wild beasts a living ionum
