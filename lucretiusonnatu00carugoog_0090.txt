law keeps all things within their limits. For even as
things begb't‘t‘di‘are in their whole nature all unlike
one the other, thus each must consist ol first-ben-
nings os unhke shape; not that a scanty number are
'possessed of a like form, but because as a rule they
do not all resemble one the other. Again since the
seeds differ, there must be a difference in the spaces
between, the passages, the connexions, the weights,
the blows, the clashings, the motions'; all which not
only disjoin living bodies, but hold apart the lands and
the whole sea, and keep all heaven away from the earth
Now mark, and apprehend precepts amassed by
my welcome toil, lest haply you deem that those
things which you see with your eyes to be· bright,
because white are formed of white principles or that
the things which are black are horn from black seed ‚3
or that things which are steeped in any other colour,
bear that colour because the bodies ol matter are
dyed with a colour like to it. For the bodies os
mattenhatoe no colour at all either like to the things
··‘oi'‘''unlike. But ” ii ''hapl'y'it 'seems to you that no
impression oi the mind can throw itsels into these
bodies, you wander far astray. Forsince men born
blind who have never beheld the light os the sun, '
yet recognise bodies by touch, though linked with no
y colour for thern from their first birth, you are to
know that bodies can fall under the ken of our mind
too, though stainedwith'no eoldil‘r]“”l'l{a‘·ffr,whatever
things we ourselves touch in the thick darkness, we⁸
do not perceive to be dyed with any colour. And
since 1 prove that this is the case, 1 will now shew
that there are things [which are possessed oi no
colour} Well any colour without any exception
