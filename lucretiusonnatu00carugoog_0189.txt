why that which to some is nauseous and bitter, may

being touched by a man's spittle wastes away and
destroys itself by gnawing its body. Again hellebore

for us is rank poison, but helps to fatten goats and
quails. That you may> know how this comes to pass
first of all you must remember what we have said
before, that the seeds which are contained in things
are mixed up in manifold ways Again all living
creatores soever which take food, even as they are
unlike on the outside, and, differing in each after its
kind, an exterior contour of limbs bounds them, so
likewise are they formed of seeds of varying shape.
Again since the seeds differ, there must be a dis·
crepancy in the spaces · between and the passages, ⁴
which we name openings, in all the limbs and mouth ⁴
and palate as well. Some openings therefore must. ,
be smaller, some larger; some things must have
them three-comered, others square ; many must be
round, some many-angled after many fashions For

as the relation between the shapes of seeds and
their motions require, the openings also must differ
accordingly in their shapes; and the passages must
vary, as varies the texture formed by the seeds
which bound them. For this reason when that which ῥ’
is sweet to some becomes bitter to others for that
creature to whom it is sweet the smoothest bodies
