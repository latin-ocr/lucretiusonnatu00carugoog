26 LUCRETIUS [soom

unerring grounds than the Pythia who speaks out
from the tripod and laurel of Phoebus, have yet gone
to ruin in the first-beginnings of things: it is there

they have fallen, and, great themselves, great and
heavy has been that sall ; first because they have
banished void from things and yet assign to them
motions, and allow things solt and rare, air sun fire

senses, so that from this you may infer that because
the things which you do not see have a bounding
point, there isa least in them. Moreover since they

have birth and to be of a body altogether mortal, the
sum of things must in that case revert to nothing and
the store of things be born anew and flourish out of
nothing: how wide now of the truth both these
doctrines are you will already comprehend. In the
next place these bodies are in many ways mutually
hostile and poisonous; and therefore they will either
perish when they have met, or will fiy asunder just as
we see, when a storm has gathered, lightnings and
rains and winds fly asunder.

Again il all things are produced from four things
and all again broken up into those things, how can
they be called first-beginnings of things any more than
things be called their first-beginnings, the supposition
being reversed? For they are begotten time about
