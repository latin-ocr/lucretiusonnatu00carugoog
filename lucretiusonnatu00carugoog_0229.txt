the woman by sudden force has overpowered and
seized for herself his force, then children are formed
from the mothers’ seed like to the mothers, as from
the fathers’ seed like to the fathers. But those
whom you see with a share of both forms, blending
equally the features of the parents, grow from the

the forms of their grandfathers' fathers, because the
parents often keep concealed in their bodies many ’ζ

produces forms, after a manifold chance and repeats
not only the features, but the voices and hair of their
forefathers. And the female sex equally springs
from the father's seed and males go forth equally
formed from the mother’s body; since these dis· “
tinctions no more proceed from the fixed seed of one

or other parent than our faces and bodies and limbs:
the birth is always formed out of the two seeds3 and
whichever parent that which is produced more re-
