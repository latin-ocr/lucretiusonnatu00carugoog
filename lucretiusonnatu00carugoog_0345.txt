plump down on the spot where this exhalation has its
course. And when it falls into it, then the same
power oi that exhalation robs all its limbs ol the
remnants os lile: first os all it causes a sort of dizzi·
ness; but afterwards, when the birds have tumbled
into the very springs of the poison, then lile too has
to be vomited forth, because all round rises up large

nus dispels whatever air lies between the birds and
earth, so that almost a void is left there. And when
the birds have arrived in their flight just opposite this
spot, at once the buoyant force oi their pinions is
crippled and rendered vain and all the sustaining
efforts of their wings are lost on both sides. So
when they are unable to buoy themselves up and
lean upon their wings, nature, you know, compels
them by their weight to tumble down to earth, and
lying stark through what is now almost a void they
disperse their soul through all the openings ol their
body. ⁴* * Again during summer the water in wells

and rapidly sends out into the air whatever seeds ol
heat it happens to have. The more then the earth is
drained os heat, the colder becomes the water which
is hidden in the earth. Again when all the earth is
compressed by cold and contracts and so to say
congeals, then, you are to know, while it contracts, it
presses out into the wells whatever heat it contains
itsell.

At the iane oi Hammon there is said to bea

fountain which is cold in the daylight and hot 'm the.
