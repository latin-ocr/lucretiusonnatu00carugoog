motion. When this air has been thoroughly heated
and raging about has imparted its heat to all the
rocks round, wherever it comes in contact with thern,
and to the earth, and has struck out from them fire
burning with swift flames, it rises up and then forces
itsels out on high straight through the gorges; and
so carries its heat sar and scatters far its ashes and
rolls on smoke of a thick pitchy blackness and flings
out at the same time stones ol prodigious weight;
leaving no doubt that this is the stormy soree of air.
’ Again the sea to a great extent breaks its waves and
sucks back its suri at the roots ol that mountain.

Caverns reach from this sea as iar as the deep gorges
of the mountain below. Through these you must
admit [that air mixed up with water passes; and] the

nature of the case compels [this air to enter in from
that] open sea and pass right within and then go out
in blasts and so list up flame and throw out stones
and raise clouds ol sand; sor on the summit are
craters, as they name them in their own language;
what we call gorges and mouths.

There are things too not a lew sor which it is not
sufficient to assign one cause ; you must give several.
one os which at the same time is the real cause. For
instance should you see the lileless body os a man
lying at some distance, it would be natural to mention
all the different causes os death', in order that the one
real cause of that man's death be mentioned among
them. Thus you may be able to prove that he has
not died by steel or cold or from disease or haply
from poison ; yet we know that it is something ol
this kind which has befallen him; and so in many
other cases we may make the same remark
