Γ arv-mv] LUCRETIUS 13

the moisture of water oozes through and all things
'·· weep with abundant drops ; food distributes itsell
through the whole body ol living things ; trees grow
and yield fruit in season, because lood is diffused
through the whole from the very roots-over the stem
aud all the boughs. Voices pass through walls and
' fly through houses shut, stiffening frost pierces to the
bones Now if there are no void parts, by what way
can the bodies severally pass? You would see it to
be quite impossible Once more, why do we see one
thing surpass another in weight though not larger in
size? For il there is just as much body in a ball of
wool as there isin a lump of lead, it is natural it lt
should weigh the same, since the property of body is
to weigh all things downwards‚ while on the contrary
the nature of void is ever without weight. Therefore
when a thing is just as large, yet is found to be
lighter‚ it proves sure enough that it has more ol :'
void iu it3 while on the other hand that which is ¹
heavier shews that there isin it more of body and ³*
that it contains within it much less ol void. There-
lore that which we are secking with keen reason
' exists sure enough, mixed up in things 3 and we call
it void
And herein I am obliged to forestall this point
which some raise‚ lest it draw you away srom the
truth The waters they say make way for the scaly
creatures as they press on, and open liquid paths,
because the fish leave room behind them, into which
the yielding waters may stream3 thus other things
too may move and change place among themselves,
although the whole sum be full. This you are to
know has been taken up on grounds wholly lalse.
