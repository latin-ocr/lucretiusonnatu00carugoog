xx INTRODUCTION

do violence to the taste of the present age to call
Lucretius the greatest os extant Latin poets. Like
the rest of his countrymen, he is not a great creative
genius ; we find in him many echoes even os the
scanty fragments which we yet possess of theold
tragic and epic poets, Accius, Pacuvius, and, above
all Ennius. He owes still more to the Greeks,
especially Empedocles so lar as regards the form of
his poem . . . From the splendid eulogies which in his
first book he passes on Ennius and Empedocles, we
may feel sure that he did not wish to conceal his
obligations, but, like other Latin poets, thought he
had a right to make what use he pleased of his Greek
and Roman predecessore And he has merits of his
own unsurpassed in the whole compass of Latin
poetry. It has often struck me that his genius is
akin to that ol Milton. He displays a wonderful
depth and lervour of thought, expressed in language
of singular force and beauty; an admirable faculty os-
clear and vigorous and well-sustained philosophical
reasoning; and a style equal in its purity and correct-
ness to that of Terence, Caesar or Cicer0, and superior
to that os any writer of the Augustan age'
