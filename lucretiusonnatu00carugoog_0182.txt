suppose the credit oi the senses to be shaken on all
hands Then to people unacquainted with the sea
ships in harbour seem to be all askew and with poop-
fittings broken to be pressing up against the water.

house, double men’s laces and men’s bodies Again
when sleep has chained down our limbs in sweet
slumber and the whole body is sunk in prolound

passing to new climates seas rivers and mountains
and to be crossing plains on loot and to hear noises‚
though the austere silence ol night prevails all round,
and to be uttering speech though quite silent. Many
are the other marvels of this sort we see, which all
seek to shake as it were the creditos the senses:
