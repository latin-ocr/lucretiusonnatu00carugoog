1024-1080] lUCRETIUS 37

And herein‚ Memmius, be far from believing this,
that all things as they say press to the centre os the
’ sum, and that for this reason the nature of the world ·
stands fast without any strokes from the outside and
the uppermost and lowest parts cannot part asunder
in any direction, because all things have been always r
pressing towards the centre (if you can believe that ἢ {f
anything can rest upon itseli); or that the heavy usa·
bodies which are beneath the earth all press upwards {335
and are at rest on the earth, turned topsy-turvy, just ᾗ j>

any more than our bodies can spontaneously fly into «ἦ
the quarters os heaven; that when those see the sun, , ,Ε
we behold the stars of night; and that they share
with us time about the seasons of heaven and pass
nights equal in length to our days. But groundless '
[error has devised such dreams] ior iools, because Q
theyhave embraced [false principles of reason] For - «ἃς
there can be no centre [where the universe is] infinite ;l „gn

take up a position there [any more on that account]
than for some quite different reason [be driven away]
For all roorn and space, which we term void, must
through centre, through nocentre alike give place to
heavy bodieS, in whatever directions their motions
tend. Nor is there any spot of such a sort that when
bodies have reached it, they can lose their force os
gravity and stand upon void; and that again which
is void must not serve to support anything, but must,

as irs nature craves, continually give place. things,
