to feel each single particle oi that wind and cold, but
rather the whole result; and then we perceive blows
take effect on our body just as is something or other
were beating it and giving us a sensation oi its body
outside Again when we thump a stone with a

colour by our touch, but rather we feel the very

ε beyond the mirr0r3 ior without doubt it is seen
r withdrawn iar within The case isjust the same as
with things which are viewed in their reality beyond
. a door, when it offers through it an unobstructed
prospect and lets many things outside he seen from
a house. That vision too is effected by two separate
airs: first there is an air scen in such acase inside
the doorway; next corne the leaves os the door right
and leit; nexta light outside brushes the eyes, then a
second air, then those things outside which are viewed
in their reality. Thus when the image os the mirror
has first discharged itsels, in coming to our sight it
pushes sorward and impels all the air which lies
between it and the eyes, and enables us to see the
whole oi it before the mirror. But when we have
perceived the mirror as well, at once the image which
is conveyed from us reaches the mirror and then is
reflected and comes back to our eyes, and drives on
and roils in front oi it a second air and lets us sec
this before itseli, and for this reason it looks sofar
withdrawn from the mirror. Wheresore again and
again I repeat there is no cause at all to wonder why
the images give back the reflexion from the suriace
