slippery serpent puts off among the thorns; for often
we see the brambles enriched with their flying spoils:
since these cases occur, a thin image likewise must be
emitted from things off their sursace. For why those
films should drop off and withdraw from things
rather than films which are really thin, not one tittle ¹

see many things discharge and freely give not only
