quite in vain, since the greatest part of these cases ⁷
cheats us on account of the, meillssl„„§l¹PP9⁵lt50ssS Α
which we add of ourselveS, taking those things as
seen which have not been seen by the senses. For
nothing is harder than to separate manifest facts from ,'
doubtful which straightway the mind adds on of itself. ξ
Again if a man believe that nothing is known, he '
knows not whether this even can be known, since ” ⁴
he admits he knows nothing. I will therefore
decline to ‚argue the case against him who places
himself with head where his feet should be. And yet
granting that he knows this, I would still put this
question, since he has never yet seen any truth in
things, whence he knows what knowing and not
knowing severally are, and what it is that has
produced the knowledge of the true and the false
and what has proved the doubtful to differ from the
certain. You will find that from the senses first has §v
proceeded the knowledge of the true and that the {of ⁴
senses cannot be refuted. „ For that which is of itself ᾗ ff
to be able to refute' things false by true things must g “⁶ l
from the nature of the case be proved to have the {179⁰
higher certainty. Well then what must fairly be ‘N
accounted of higher certainty than sense? Shall
reason founded on false sense be able to contradict
them, wholly founded as it is on the senses? and if
they are not true, then¹ all reason as well is rendered
false. Or shall the ears be able to take the eyes to ’
task, or the touch the ears? Again shall the taste
call in question this touch, or the nostrils refute or
the eyes controvert it? Not s0, I guess; for each ³
apart has its own distinct office, each its own power ;
and therefore we must perceive what is solt and coxo]
