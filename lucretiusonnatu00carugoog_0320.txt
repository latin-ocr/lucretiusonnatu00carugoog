226 LUCRETIUS [aoonn

It can also be explained how the windS, when
they blow through the clouds, make noises: we see
branching and rough clouds often borne along in
many ways; thus, you are to know, when the blasts
os the northwest blow through a dense „forest the
leaves give forth a rustling and the boughs a crash-
ing. Sometimes too the force os the strong wind in
rapid motion rends the cloud, breaking through it by
an assault right in front: what a blast ol wind can
do there, is shewn by facts plain to sense, when here
on earth where it is gentler it yet twists out tall trees
and tears them up from their deepest roots. There
are also waves among the clouds and they give a
kind os roar as they break heavily3 J'ust as in deep
rivers and on the great sea when the suri breaks.
Sometimes too when the burning soree os thunder
has fallen out os one cloud into another, is haply the
latter contains much moisture when it has taken the
fire into it, it drowns it at once with a loud noise;
just so iron glowing hot from the fiery furnaces
sometimes hisses, whemwe have plunged it quickly
into cold water. Again if the cloud which receives
the fire is drier, it is seton fire in an instant and

ι burns witha loud noise; just as if a fleme should
³ range over the laurei-covered hills through a whirl·
wind and burn them up with its impetuous assault ;
and there is not anything that burns in the crackling
flame with a more startling sound than the Delphic
laurel os Phoebus. Then osten too much crashing os

κ ice and tumbling in of hail make a noise in the great
clouds on high; for when the wind packs them
together into a confined space, the mountains ol
stom-clouds congealed and mixed with hail break up.
