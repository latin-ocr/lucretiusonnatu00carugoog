case of those to whom the same thing is bitter within,
rougb and barbed seeds sure enough pass down the
ἱ1 throat It is easy now from these principles to
- understand all particular cases: thus when a fever
has attacked any one from too great a flow oi bile,
or a violent disease has been excited in any other
way, thereupon the whole body is disordered and all
the arrangements os particles then and there changed ;
the consequence of which is that the bodies which
before were suited to excite sensafion, suit no more; ⁷
and those fit it better, which are able to make their
way in and beget a bitter sense. Both kinds sor
instance are mixed up in the flavour oi honey: a
point we have often proved before.

Now mark me, and I will discuss the way in
which the contact of smell affects the nostrils: and
first there must be many things from which a varied
flow os smells streams and rolls on; and we must
suppose that they thus stream and discharge and
disperse themselves among all things alike3 but one
smell fits itself better to one creature, another to
another ou account oi their unlike shapes; and there-
fore bees are drawn on by the smell os honey through
the air to avery great distance, and so are vultures
by carcases. Also the onward-reaching power oi
‚ scent in dogs leads them whithersoever the cloven
hooi of wild beasts has carried them in their
course; and the smell of man is felt sar away by the
saviour oi the Romans' citadel‚ the bright white
goose. Thus different scents assigned to different
creaturos led each to its appropriate food and con-
strain‘ them to recoil from nauseous poison, and in
this way the races oi beasts are preserved.
