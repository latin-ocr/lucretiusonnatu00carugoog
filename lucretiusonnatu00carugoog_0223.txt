whole body and meets together in appropriate places
and rouses forthwith the appropriate parts of the
body. The places are excited and swell with seed, ’
and the inclination arises to emit the seed towards
that to which the fell desire all tends, and the body
seeks that object from which the mind is wounded
by love; sor all as a rule sall towards their wound
and the blood spirts out in that direction whence
comes the stroke by which we are struck; and if he

s is at close quarters, the red stream covers the foe.
Thus then he who gets a hurt from the weapons of ·
Venus, whatever be the object that hits him, inclines
to the quarter whence he is wounded, and yearns to
unite with it and join body with body ; ior a mute
desire gives a presage of the pleasure.

This pleasure is lor us Venus ; from that desire is
the Latin name of love, from that desire has first
trickled into the heart yon drop of Venus' honeyed joy,
succeeded soon by chilly care; lor though that which
you love is away, yet idols of it are at hand and its
sweet name is present to the ears. But it is meet to
fly idols and scare away all that feeds love and turn
your mind on another object, distract your passion ¹
elsewhere and not keep it, with your thoughts once
set on one object by love oi it, and so lay up lor
yourself care and unsailing pain. For the sore gathers ᾗ
strength and becomes inveterate by feeding, and l
every day the madness grows in violence and the ἕ
misery becomes aggravated, unless you erase the
first wounds by new blows and first heal them when
yet fresh, roaming abroad after Venus the pandemian,
or transfer to something else the emotions oi your

mind.
