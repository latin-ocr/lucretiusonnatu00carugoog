first of all you must remember what we have said
before, that the seeds which are contained in things

be smaller, some larger; some things must have
them three-comered, others square ; many must be
round, some many-angled after many fashions. For
as the relation between the shapes of seeds and
their motions require, the openings also must differ
accordingly in their shapes3 and the passages must
vary, as varies the texture formed by the seeds ,ι
which bound them. For this reason when that which ’
