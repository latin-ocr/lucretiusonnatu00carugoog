236 LUCRETIUS [soor v1

does he hurl into the sea? oi what has he to impeach
its waters and liquid mass 3ηά floating fields? Again
if he wills us to avoid the thunderstroke, why fears
he to let us see it dischargedi or if he wills to crush
us off our guard with his fire, why thunders hesrom
that side, to enable us to shun it? why stirs he up
beforehand darkness and roarings and rumblings?
And how can you believe that he hurls at many
points at the same time? or would you venture to
maintain that it never has happened that more than
one stroke was made at one time? Nay osten 3ηά
osten it has happened and must happen that, even
as it rains aud showers fall in many different
quartem, so many thunderings go on at one time
Once more why does he dash down the holy sanc-
tuaries of the gods and his own gorgeous seats with
the destroying thunderbolt, and break the finewrought
idols of the gods, and spoil his own images of their
glory by an overhearing wound? and why does he
mostly aim at lorty spots, 3ηά why do we see most
traces of his fire on the mountain tops?

To proceed, it is easy from these facts to under-
stand in what way those things, which the Greeks
- from their nature have named presteres, come
down srom above into the sea. For sometimes
a pillar so to speak is let down from heaven and
descends into the sea, 3ηά round about it the surges
boii, stirred up by heavy blasts oi winds; and all
ships caught in that turmoil are dashed about 3ηά
brought into extreme danger. This takes place
when at times the force os the wind put in motion
cannot burst the cloud which it essays to burst, but

weighs it down, so that it is iike a pillar let down
