194 LUCRETIUS [soosv

’ἡ recedes from the sun’s orb, until just opposite to him
she has shone out with full light and at her rising as
she soars alost has beheld his setting; and then by
slow steps reversing as it were her course she must
in the same way hide her light, the nearer and nearer
she now glides to the sun from a different quarter
through the circle oi the signs; according to the
theory os those who suppose the moon to be like
a ball and to hold on her course under the sun. She
may also very possibly revolve with her own light
and display various pheses ol brightness; forthere
may well be another body which is carried on and
glides in her company getting before her path and
obstructing her in all manner'ol ¹ways and yet cannot
be seen, because it glides on without light. She ,may
also revolve, like it may be to a spherical ball steeped
over one hals in shining light, and as she rolls round
this sphere she may present changing phases, until
she has turned that half which is illuminated full
towards our sight and open eyes ; then by slow steps
she whirls back and withdraws the light-fraught hals
of the spherical ball; as the Babylonian science ol
the Chaldees refuting the system os the astronomers
essays to prove in opposition to them ; just as though
that which each party fights sor might not be equally

’ true, or there were any reason why you should

venture to embrace the one theory less than the
other. Again, why a new moon should not be bom
every day after a regular succession of forms and
regular phases, and each day the one which is bom
perish and another be produced in its room and
stead‚ it is not easy to teach by reasoning or prove
by words, since so many things can be born in such
