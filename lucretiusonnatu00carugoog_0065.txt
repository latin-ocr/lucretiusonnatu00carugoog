when clods of earth have been crumbled, kinds of
grasses and com and leaves should be found to lurk
distributed among the earth in minute quantities;
and lastly that ash and smoke and minute fires
should be found latent in woods, when they were

that none of, these results follows, you are to know
that things are not so mixed up in things ; but rather
