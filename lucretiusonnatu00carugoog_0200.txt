'y case ol those to whom the same thing is bitter within,
„ y rough and barbed seeds sure enough pass down the
l throat. It is easy now from these principles to
ἶ, understand all particular cases: thus when a sever
'² has attacked any one from too great a flow os bile,
or a violent disease has been excited in any other
way, thereupon the whole body is disordered and all
, the arrangements of particles then and there changed;
the consequence of which is that the bodies which
before were suited to excite sensation, suit no more;
⁸ and those fit it better, which are able to make their
way in and begeta bitter sense. Both kinds lor
instance are mixed up in the flavour ol honey: a
point we have osten proved before.

Now mark me, and I will discusse the way in
which the contact of smell affects the nostrils: and
first there must be many things from which a varied
flow os smells stretms and rolls 0n; and we must
suppose that they thus stream and discharge and
disperse themselves among all things alike; but one
smell fits itself better to one creature, another to
another on account of their unlike shapes; and there-
sore bees are drawn on by the smell of honey through
the air to avery great distance, and so are vultures
by carcases. Also the onward-reaching power ol

⁵ scent in dogs leads them whithersoever the cloven
¹ honi oi wild beasts has carried them in their
course3 and the smell os man is felt sar away by the
’ saviour oi the Romans' citadel‚ the bright white
goose. Thus different scents assigned to different
creatures led each to its appropriate iood and con·
strain‘ them to recoil from nauseous poison, and in

this way the races os beasts are preserved.
