Again why does untamed fierceness go along with
the sullen brood of lions, cunning with foxes and
proneness to flight with stags? and to take any other
instance of the kind ,why are malQQeFssSndesed

derived frlom its proper seed and breed grows up

together with the whole body? If it were immortal

being dissolved too throughout the imme, 1n order
at last to die oue aud all together with the body.
But if they shall say that souls of men always go
into human bodies I yet will ask how it is a soul

may be sure they will fly to the subterfuge that the
mind grows weakly in a weakly body. But granting
this is so, you must admit the soul to be mortal,
since changed so completely throughout the frame
it loses its former life and sense. Then too in what
way will it be able to grow in strength uniformly
with its allotted body and reach the couetcd hower
