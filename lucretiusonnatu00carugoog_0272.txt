world in which it is embodied and lives. For this ι
reason it is no burden and does not weigh down the
- air; just as his limbs are of no weight to a man nor
is his head a burden to his neck, nor do we feel that
the whole weight of the body rests on the leet3 but
whatever weights come from without and are laid·
upon us, hurt us though they are often very much
smaller: of such great moment it is what function
each thing has to perform. Thus then the earth is
not an alien body suddenly brought in and forced
from some other quarter on air alien to it, but was
conceived together with it at the first birth of the
world and is a fixed portion of that world, just as our
limbs are seen to be to us. Again the earth when
suddenly shaken by loud thunder shakes by its
motion all the things which are above it; and this it
could in no wisc do, unless it had been fast bound
with the airy portions of the world and with heaven.
For the earth and they cohere with one another by
common roots, conjoined and formed into a single
being from the beginning of their existence. 'See
you not too that great as is the weight oi our body,
the force of the soul, though of the extremest finenem,
supports it, because it is so closely conjoined and
formed into a single being with it? Then too what
is able to lift the body with a nimble bound save the
force of the mind which guides the limbs? Now do
you see what power a subtle nature may have, when
Ι it is conjoined with a heavy body, as the air is
conjoined with the earth and the force of the mind
