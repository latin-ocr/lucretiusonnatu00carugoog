we have nothing to 'fear after death, and that he who ·
exists not, cannot become miserable, and that it ⁵
matters not a whit whether he has been born into life
at any other time, when immortal death has taken
away his mortal lif . Δ ¹
Therefore when you see a man bemoaning his
hard case, that after death he shall either rot with
his body laid in the grave or be devoured by flames
or the jaws of wild beasts, you may be sure that his ·
ring betrays a flaw and that there lurks in his heart a
secret goad, though he himself declare that he does
not believe that any sense will remain to him after
death. He does not methinks really grant the con-
clusion which he professes to grant nor the principle
on which he so professes, nor does he take aud force
himself root aud branch out of life, but all uncon-
sciously imagines something of self to survive. For
when any one in life suggests to himself that birds
and beasts will tend his body after death, he makes
moan for himself: he does not separate himself from
that self, nor withdraw himself fully from the body
so thrown out, aud fancies himself that other self and
stands by and impregnates it with his own sense
Hence he makes much moan that he has been born
mortal, and sees not that after real death there will be
no other self to remain in life and lament to self that his
own self has met death, and there to stand and grieve
that his own self there lying is mangled or bumt
For if it is an evil after death to be pulled about by
the devouring jaws of wild beasts,I cannot see why
it should not be a cruel pain to be laid on fires and
burn in hot flames, or to be placed in honey and --

stifled or to stiffen with cold, stretehed onthesmootb ’,4
