deep-sunk, temples hollow‚ the skin cold and hard, on
the grim mouth a grin, the brow tense and swollen3

did not know themselves. And though bodies lay
in heaps above bodies unburied on the ground, yet

bird appear, or the sullen breeds oi wlld beasts
quit the forests. Many would droop with disease
and die: above all faithful dogs would lie stretched
in all the streets and yield up breath with a struggle ;
