assume, but because many in number and shisting
about in many ways throughout the universe they
are driven and tormented by blows during infinite
time past, aiter trying motions and unions ol every
kind at length they sall into arrangements such as
those out of which this our sum os things has been ’
formed, and by which :too ¹it is preserved through
many great years when once it has been thrown into
the appropriate motions, and causes the streams to
replenish the greedy sea with copious river waters
and the earth, fostered by the heat of the sun, to
renew its produce, and the race os living things to
come up and flourish, and the gliding fires os ether
v ν to live: all which these several things could in no
wise bring to pass, unless a store of matter could rise
up from infinite space, out of which store they are
wont to make up in due season whatever has been
lost. For as the nature ol living things when robbed
of lood loses its substance and wastes away, thus
all things must be broken up, as soon as matter has
ceased to be supplied, diverted in any way lrom its
proper course. Nor can blows irorn without hold
together all the sum which has been brought into
union. They can it is true frequently strike upon
and stay a part, until others come and the sum can
be completed. At times however they are com·
pelled to rebound and in so doing grant to the first·
beginnings of things room and time lor ssight, to
enable them to get clear away from the mass in
union. Whereiore again and again Ι repeat many
bodies must rise up 3 nay lor the blows themselves
n'ot to fail, there is need ol an infinite supply ol
. matter on all sides
