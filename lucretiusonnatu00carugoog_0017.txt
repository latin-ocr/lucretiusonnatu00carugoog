s INTRODUCTION xiii

Munro was of middle height, with broad shoulders
and a general look ol strength and vigour. His hair,
very abundant and nut-brown in colour, and parted
in the middle, curled and waved close to his head ;
he had a habit ol' tugging and pulling at it while
talking3 he wore neither beard nor moustache. The
forehead was remarkably broad, a peculiarity which '
had gained him the nickname of ‘the ox’ in his
schooldays. The eyes were blue-grey and very ex-
pressive, the nose large ; the mouth was generally
closely compressed and the comers turned down.
There was something leonine-a combination of
strength 'and benignity-in his expression· When
he smiled, the whole lace seemed to lighten up. lt
is unfortunate that the bust ol him which stands
in Trinity Library‚ a posthumous bust executed by
Woolner‚ is not really like him. The photograph
which hangs by the bust reproduces very faithfully
an expression which might osten be seen on his sace.

, Allwho read Munro’s books with intelligence can
recognise some ol the prominent features of his cha·
racter-his frank directness, painstaking accuracy, and
manly enthusiasm. Those who knew him in life could
see somewhat deeper into his nature: Mr. Sedley
Taylor, who saw him often in college life, wrote ol
him: “My memory ol Munro will always retain an
inspiring sense of transparent honesty of purpose and
of thought, unshrinking open-handed liberality, the
staunchest and most whole-hearted devotion to the
highest interests, as he conceived them, of the founda-
tion in which his own lile was bound up, and a scom
ol all things underhand, mean, or cowardly the like os
which Ι can remember in no other human being.''

And yet there was something more than all this 'm
