summer fires to chill lrosts a definite path is traced

out and in like manner is again travelled back; lor

every degree of cold and heat and intermediate

warmths lie between those extremes, filling up in

succession the sum. Thereforethe.‚.things produced *
&Qite degrees, since at both ends they are

marked off by points, one at one, another at the other

end, molested on theone hand by flames, on the

other by stiffening frosts.

And now that Ι have shewn this, 1 will go on to ,
link to it a truth which depends on this and from this ¹
draws its proof: the first-beginnings oi things which· ζ
have a like shape one with the other, are infinite in f
number. For since the difference os forms is finite, J
those which are like must be infinite or the sum ol ’
matter will be finite, which 1 proved not to be the
case, when l shewed in my verses that the minute
bodies of matter from everlasting continually uphold
the sum of things through an uninterrupted succession
of blows on all sides. For though you see that some
animala are rarer than others and discem a less fruitlul
nature in them, yet in another quarter and spot and
in distant lands there may be many of that kind and
the full tale may be made up; just as we see that in
the class ol four-footed beasts snake-handed elephants
are elsewhere especially numerous; for India is so
fenced about with an ivory rampart made out ol
many thousands ol these, that its inner parts cannot
be reached, so great is the quantity ol brutes, of
which we see but very few samples. But yet though
1 should grant this point too: be there even as you
ι will some one thing sole in its kind existing‘alone

with a body that had birth, and let no other thing
