never be reproduced in all remaining time. But
now sure enough a fixed limit to their breaking
has been set, since we see each thing renewed,
and at the same time definite periods fixed lor
things each after its kind to reach the flower of
their age. Moreover while the bodies os matter are
most solid, it may yet be explained in what way all
things which are formed solt, as air water earth lires,
are so formed and by what force they severally go
on, since once sor all there is void mixed up in things.
But on the other hand if the first-beginnings ol things
be solt, it cannot be explained out ol what enduring
basalt and iron can be produced; ior their whole
nature will utterly lack a first foundation to begin
with. First·beginnings therefore are strong in solid
singleness‚ and by a denser combination oi these all
things can be closely packed and exhibit enduring
strength.

Again ir no limit hasbeen set to the breaking of
bodies, nevertheless the several bodies which go to
things must survive from etemity up to the present
time, not yet assailed by any danger. But since they
are possessed of a srail nature, it is not consistent
with this that they could have continued through

Again too since a limit os growing and sustaining

and since by the laws oi nature it stands decreed
what they can each do and what they cannot do,
and since nothing is changed, but all things are so
constant that the different birds all in succession
exhibit in their body the distinctiue marks of their
