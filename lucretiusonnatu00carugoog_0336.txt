and retire, for this reason the earth oftener threatens
to fall than really falls: it leans over and then sways
back again, and after tumbling forward recovers in
equal poise its fixed position. For this reason the
whole house rockS, the top more than the middle, the
middle than the bottom, the bottom in a very very
slight degree.

The same great quaking likewise arises from this
cause, when on a sudden the wind and some enormous
force of air gathering either from without or within
the earth have flung themselves into the hollows of
the earth, and there chafe at first with much uproar
among the great caverns and are carried on witha
whirling motion, and when their force afterwards

’ stirred and lashed into fury bursts abroad and at the
same moment cleaves the deep earth and opens upa
great yawning chasm. This fell out in Syrian Sidon
and took place at Aegium in the Peloponnese‚ two
towns which an outbreak of wind of this sort and the
ensuing earthquake threw down. And many walled
places besides fell down by great commotions on
land and many towns sank down engulphed in the
sea together with theIr burghers. And if they do
not break out, still the impetuous fury of the air and
the fierce violence of the wind spread over the
numerous passages of the earth like a shivering-fit
and thereby cause a trembling; just as cold when it
has pierced into our frames to the very marrow, sets
them a-shivering in spite of themselves, forcing thern
to shake and move. Men are therefore disturbed by
a twofold terror throughout their cities: they fear the
roofs above their heads, they dread lest the nature

of the earth in a moment break up her caverns
