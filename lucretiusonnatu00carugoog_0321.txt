132—186] LUCRETIUS 227

It lightens too, when the clouds have struck out
by their collision many seeds of fire; just as if a
stone were to strike another stone or a piece of iron;
for then too light bursts out and fire scatters about
bright sparks But we hear the thunder with our
ears after the eyes see the flash of lightning, because
things always travel more slowly to the ears than
those which excite vision travel to the eyes. This
you may perceive from the following instance as
well: when you see a man at a distance cutting with
a double-edged axe a large tree‚ you perceive the
stroke before the blow carries the sound to the ear:
thus we see lightning too before we hear the thunder,
which is discharged at the same time as the fire from
the same cause, being born indeed from the same
collision.

Also in the following manner clouds dye places
with winged light and the storrn flashes out with a
rapid quivering movement. When the wind has
made its way into a cloud and whirling about in it
has, as I have shewn above, made the cloud hollow
with a dense crust, it becomes hot by its own velocity:
thus you see all things thoroughly heated and fired
by motion; nay a leaden ball in wbirling through a
long course even melts. When therefore this wind
now on fire has rent the black cloud, it scatters
abroad at once seeds oi fire pressed out by force so
to speak‚ and these produce the throbbing flashes of
flame ; then follows a sound which strikes on the ears
more slowly than the things which travel to our eyes
strike on thern. This you are to know takes place
when the clouds are dense and at the same time piled
up on high one above the other in rnarwehous
