INTRODUCTION xvii

that his short life was spent in study and retirement
There is an ancient tradition to the effect that he
suffered from fits ol insanity and died by his own
hand. This tradition has been followed by Tennyson
in his noble poem of Lucretius.

The purpose of the poem is to convert the reader
to the Epicurean system of philosophy. At some time
in his lise Lucretius had fallen in with this system and
had embraced it as the final and complete solution of
‘the riddle of this painful earth'3 and now he seeks
to set before the world the precious knowledge which
has brought peace of mind to his own heart. The
adornment of poetry he regards merely as a device to
make the philosophie teaching more palatable.

The poem begins with an invocation to Venus and
a dedication to Memmius who was prominent, in
the politieal disturbances of the time, as an opponent
of Caesar. Itis remarkable that Catullus also was

’ brought into close personal relations with the same
Memmius. The next paragraphs contain a magnifi-
cent panegyric on Epicurus for whom Lucretius selt
so deep a reverence that he is unwilling to mention
him by name, a defence of the system against the
charge of irreligion‚ and a statement, or rather two
statements, of the eontents of the poem. Three main
subjects are to be treated os : the atomic theory, the
nature of the soul, the phenomena of the heavens.
The preiaee then ends, and the philosophy is ex-
pounded from its first principle ‘that nothing is l
produced from nothing ’, or, in other words, that the '²
sum ol matter in the universe is constant, everything

’ that exists being a new form ol some previously
existing matter.
