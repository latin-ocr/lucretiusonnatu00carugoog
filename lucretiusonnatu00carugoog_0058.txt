then throws a winged javelin, do you choose that
when hurled with vigorous force it shall advance to
the point to which it has been sent and fly toa

its way and stop it? ior you must admit and adopt

way I will go on and, wherever you have placed the
outside borders, I will ask what then becomes ol the
javelin. The result will be that an end can no where

enclosed within fixed borders and were bounded, in
that case the store os matter by its solid weights
would have streamed together srom all sides to the
lowest point nor could anything have gone on under
the canopy oi heaven, no nor would there have been
a heaven nor sunlight at all, inasmuch as all matter,
settling down through infinite time past, would lie
together in a heap. But as it is, sure enough no rest
is given to the bodies oi the first-beginnings, because

there is no lowest point at all, to which they might
