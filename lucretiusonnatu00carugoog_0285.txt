things has been discovered lately, and I the very
first 01 all have only now been soupd able to transfer
it into native words. But it haply you believe that
before this all things have existed just the same, but
that the generations 01 rnen have perished by burning
heat, or that cities have fallen by sorne great con-
cussion 01 the world, or that after constant rains
devouring rivers have gone forth over the earth and
have whelmedtowns, so much the more you must
yield and admit that there will be entire destruction
too 01 earth and heaven; lor when things were tried
by so great distempers and so great dangers, at that
time had a more disastrous cause pressed upon them,
they would iar and wide have gone to destruction
and mighty ruin. And in no other way are we
proved to be mortals, except because we all alike in
turn iall sick 01 the sarne diseases which those had
whom nature has withdrawn from lise.

Again whatever things last sor ever, must either,
because they are 01 solid body, repel strokes and not
suffer aught to pass into them, sufficient to disunite
the closely massed parts within: such are the bodies
01 matter whose nature we have shewn before: or
they must be able to endure through all time sor
this reason, because they are exempt from blows, as
void is which rernains untouched and suffers not a
jot irorn any stroke; or else because there is no
extent 01 room around, into which things soto say
may depart and be broken up: in this way the sum
01 sumsis eternal and there isno place outside into
’ which things may spring asunder, nor are there any
bodies which can sall upon them aud dissolve thern
by a powersul blow. But the nature 01 the worhhas.
