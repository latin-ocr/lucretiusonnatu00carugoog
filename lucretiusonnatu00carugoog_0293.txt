beget and continue their kinds ; first a supply ol
food, then away by which the birth-producing seeds
throughout the frame may stream from the relaxed
limbs3 also in order that the woman may be united
with the male, the possession of organs whereby they
may each interchange mutual joys.

And many races of living things must then have

died out and been unable to beget and continue their
breed. For in the case of all things which you see
breathing the breath of life, either craft or courage or
else speed has from the beginning of its existence
protected and preserved each particular race. And
there are many things which, recommended to us by
their useful services, continue to exist consigned to
our protection. ·In the first place the fierce breed of
lions and the savage taces their courage has pro·
tected, foxes their craft and stags their proneness to
flight. But light-sleeping dogs with faithful heart in
breast and every kind which is born of the seed of
beasts of ¹burden and at the same time the woolly
flocks and the homed herds are all consigned, Mem·
mius, to the protection ot' man. For they have ever
fled with eagemess from wild beasts and have ensued
peace and plenty of food obtained without their own
labour, as we give it in requital of their useful services.
But those to whom nature has granted none of these
qualities, so that they could neither live by their own
means nor perform for us any useful service in return
for which we should suffer their kind 'to feed and be
safe under our protection‚ those, you are to knoW,
would lie exposed as a prey and booty of others,
hampered all in their own death-bringing shackles,
until nature brought that kind to utter destruction.
