their hands and outlive many generations of living
men, il not because an unchanging matter hasbeen
assigned for begetting things and what can arise out

that nothing can come from nothing, since things Ι,
require seed before they can severally be born and
be brought out into the buxom fields of air. Lastly
since we see that tilled grounds surpass untilled and
yield a better produce by the labour of hands, we
may infer that there are in the. earth first-beginnings
ol things which by turning up the sruitlul clods with

stimulate to rise. But if there were not such, you
would see all things without any labour of ours
spontaneously come forth in much greater perlection.
f Moreover nature dissolves every thing back into

if aught were mortal in 311 its parts alike, the thing
in a moment would be snatched away to destruction
from before our eyes; since no force would be needed
to produce disruption among its parts and undo their
sastenings. Whereas in lact, as all things consist of
an imperishable seed, nature suffers the destruction
of nothing to be seen, until a sorce has encountered
it sufficient to dash things to pieces by a blow or to
pierce through the void places within them and break
them up. Again if time, whenever it makes away
with things through age, utterly destroys them eating
up 311 their matter, out of what does Venus bring

each after its kind, or, when they are brought back,
out os what does earth manifold in works give them
