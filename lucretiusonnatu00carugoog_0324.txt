Thunderbolts we must suppose to be begotten
out os dense clouds piled up high ; for they are never
sent forth at all when the sky is cl'earor when the

all question is proved by facts evident to sense:
clouds at such times form so dense a mass over the

heaven, falls in such wise upon the waters heavily
charged with darkness afar off and draws down a
black tempest big with lightnings and storms‚ itself
so fraught above all the rest with fires and winds‚ that
even on land men shudder and seek shelter. Thus
then we must suppose that the storm above our head
reaches high up; for the clouds would never bury the
earth in such thick darkness, unless they were built

up high heap upon heap, the sunlight totally dis·
