shouldst outlast all races ol things now living, nay
even more is thou shouldst never die,’ what answer
have we to make save this, that nature sets up against
us a well-founded claim and puts forth in her pleading
a true indictmentl 1r however one of greater.age
and more advanced in years should complain and
lament poor wretch his death more than is right,
would she not with greater cause raise her voice and
rally him in sharp accents‚ ‘away frorn this time
forth with thy tears, rascal; a truce to thy corn-
f plainings: thou decayest after lull enjoyment of all
¹ the prizes oi lise. But because thou ever yearnest lor ·
what is not present, and despisest what is, life has

v slipped lrorn thy grasp unfinished and unsatislying‚

and or ever thou thoughtest, death has taken his
stand at thy pillow‚ before thou canst take thy
departure sated and filled with good things. Now
however resign all things unsuited to thy age, and
with a good grace up and greatly go: thou must!
With good reason methinks she would bring her
charge, with reason rally and reproach; lor old things
give way and are supplanted by new without sail,
and one thing must ever be replenished out of other
things; and no one is delivered over to the pit and
black Tartarus: matter is needed ior alter genera·
tions to grow; all of which though will follow thee
when they have finished their terrn oi lile; and thus
it is that all these no less than thou have before this
corne to an end and hereafter will corne to an end.
'Thus one thing will never cease to rise out-ol another,
and lile is granted to none in see-simple, to all in
usufruct Think), too >how the bygone antiquity ol
everlasting time before our birth was nothing to us.
