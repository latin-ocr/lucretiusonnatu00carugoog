258 LUCRETIUS [eoos vr

front of the ring has been made rarer and the space
more empty and void, it follows at once that all the
air which lies behind, carries and pushes it on as
it were at its back. For the air which lies around
them always beats on things ; but at such a time
as this itis able to push on the iron, because on
one side a space is void and receives the iron into
it This air of which Ι am speaking to you makes
its way with much subtlety through the frequent
pores of the iron to its minute parts and then thrusts
and pushes it on, as the wind a ship and its sails.
Again all things must have air in their body, since
they are of a rare body and air surrounds and is
in contact with all things. This air therefore which
is in the inmost recesses of the iren, is ever stirred
in restless motion and therefore beats the ring with·
out a doubt and stirs it within, you know: the ring
is carried in the direction in which it has once
plunged forward, and into the void part towards
which it has made its start.

Sometimes too it happens that the nature of iron
is repelled from this stone, being in the habit of
flying from and following it in turns 1 have seen
Samothracian iron rings even jump up, and at the
same time filings of iron rave within brass basins,
when this Magnet stone had been placed under:
such a strong desire the iron seems to have to fly
from the stone. So great a disturbance is raised by
the interposition ol the brass, because sure enough
when the current of the brass has first seized on and
taken possession of the open passages of the iron,
the current os the stone comes after and finds all
things full in the iron and has no opening to swim
