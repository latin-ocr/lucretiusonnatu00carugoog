gods? and all the more so that he was wont to ¹
deliver many precepts in beautiful and god-like
phrase about the immortal gods themselves and to
open up by his teachings all the nature os things.
While walking in his sootsteps I follow out his
reasonings and teach by my verses, by what law all
things are made, what necessity there is then for
them to continue in that law, and how impotent
they are to annul the binding statutes ol time:
foremost in which class ol things the nature os the
mind hasbeen proved to be formed oia body that
had birth and to be unable to endure unscathed
through great time, mere idols being wont to mock
the mind in sleep, when we seem to see him whom
life has abandoned: to continue, the order of my

design has now brought me to this point, where 1

must proceed to shew that the world is formed of a
mortal body and at the same time had birth ; to
shew too in what way that union ol matter founded
earth heaven sea stars sun and the ball of the
moon; also what living creatures sprang out of
the earth, as well as those which never at any time
were bom; in what way too mankind began to use
with one another varied speech by the names
conferred on things; and also in what ways yon
sear os the gods gained an entry into men’s breasts‚
and now throughout the world maintains as holy
sanes lakes groves altars and idols ol the gods.
Furthermore I shall make clear by what force
piloting nature'guides the courses of the sun and ’
the wanderings oi the moon ; lest haply we imagine
that these os their own free will between heaven
and earth traverse their everlasting orbrts, grae'xousxv
