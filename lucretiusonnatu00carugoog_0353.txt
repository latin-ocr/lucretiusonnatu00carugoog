against and beat with its wave the iron tes'cture ; by
which means it repels from it and sets in motion
through the brass that which without the brass it
often draws to itself. And sorbeat herein to wonder
that the current from this stone is not able to set

stand still by the power of their own weight3 for
instance gold; and others, because they are of so
rare a body that the current flies through them
uninterrupted, cannot in any case be setin motion;

therefore the nature of iron lying between the 'two
has received into it certain first bodies of brass,
then do the Magnet stones set it in motion with
their stream.

And yet these cases are not so much at variance
with other things, that Ι have only a scanty store of
similar instances to relate of things mutually fitted
one for the other and for nothing else: stones for
instance you see are cemented by mortar alone;
wood is united with wood so firmly by bulls’ glue
only, that the veins of boards often gape in cracks
before the binding power of the glue can be brought
to loosen its hold. Viae-born juices venture to mix
with streams of water, though heavy pitch and light
oil cannot. Again the purple dye of the shellfish so

in any case be severed, not were you to take pains
to undo what is done with Neptune's wave‚ not if
the whole sea were willed to wash it out with all its
waters. Then too is there not one thing only that
fastens gold to gold, and is not brass soldered to
