They made trial os bulls too in the service
of war and essayed to send savage boars against
the enemy. And some sent before them valorous
lions with armed trainers and courageous keepers to
guide them and to hold them in chains; but in
vain, since heated with promiscuous slaug'hter they
would disorder in their rage the troops without
distinction, shaking all about the frightlul crests
upon their heads; and the horsemen were not able
to calm the breasts ol the horses scared by the
roaring and turn them with the bridle upon the
enemy. The lionesses with a spring would throw
their enraged bodies on all sides and would attack
in the vlace those who met them, and others
off their guard they would tear down from behind
and twining round them would bring them to the
ground overpowered by the wound, fastening on
them with firm bite and with hooked claws. The
bulls would toss their own friends and trample them
under soot, and gore with their horns the flanks and
bellies of the horses underneath and turn up the earth
with threatening front The boars too would rend
their friends with powersul tusks, in their rage dying
with their blood the weapons broken in them, ay
dying with their blood the weapons broken in their
own bodies; and would put to promiscuous rout

horse and foot3 sor the tame beasts would try to
avoid by shying to the side the cruel push ol the
tusk, or would rear up and paw the winds, all in
vain, since you might see them tumble down
with their tendons severed and straw the ground
