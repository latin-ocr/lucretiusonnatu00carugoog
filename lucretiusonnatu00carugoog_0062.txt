, ot' water, [both such as descend to the earth in rain]
and those which are held in by the earth's body, so to
say, the fiuid of the sea and great waters from the
mountains3 while on the other hand they teach that
the subtle clement of air and hot fires at the same
time are carried away from the centre and that ior
this reason the whole ether round bickers with signs and ,
the sun’s flame is fed throughout the blue of heaven,
because heat flying from the centre all gathers to·
gether there, and that ‘the topmost boughs os trees
could not put forth leaves at all, unless from time to
time [nature supplied] food from the earth to each
[throughout both stem and boughs, their reasons are
not only false, but they contradict each other. Space
,p 1 have already proved to be infinite ; and space being
'¹ infinitematter as l have said must also be infinite]
lest alter the winged iashion os flames the walls of the
world should suddenly break up and fly abroad along
the mighty void, and all other things follow ior like
reasons and the innermost quarters of heaven tumble
in from above and the earth in an instant withdraw
from beneath our ieet and amid the commingled
ruins of things in it and of heaven, ruins unloosing
the first bodies, should wholly pass away along the ·.
unfathomable void, so that in a moment oi time not ·
awrack should bc leit behind, nothing save untenanted
space and viewless first-beginnings. For on whatever -
side you shall first determine first bodies to be want-
mg, this sicle will be the gate oi death ior things,
