108 LUCRETIUS [nomm

Again are seeds of the soul left in the dead body
or not? Ii they are left and remain in it, the soul
c'annot fairly be deemed immortal, since it has
withdrawn lessened by the loss of some parts; but
if when taken away from the yet untainted limbs it
has fied so entirely away as to leave in the body
no parts of itself, whence do carcases exude worms
from *the now rank flesh and whence does such a
swarm os living things, boneless and bloodless, surge
through the heaving lramei But if haply you believe
tha! souls find their way into worms from without and
can severally pass each into a'body and you make
no account of why many thousands of souls meet
together in a place from which one has withdrawn,
this question at least must, it seems, be raised and ,
brought to a decisive test, whether souls hunt out
the several seeds ol worms and' „bussd for themselves
a place to dwell in, or find their way into bodies fully
formed so to say. But why they should on their
part make a body or take such trouble, cannot be
explained; since being without a body they are not
plagued as they flit about with diseases and cold and
hunger, the body being more akin to, more troubled
by such infirmitieS, and by its contact with it the
mind suffering many ills. Nevertheless be it ever so
expedient for them to make a body, when they are
going to enter, yet clearly there is no way by which
they can do so. Therefore souls do Qje...f0f
themselves bodies and„limbs'*';'“n'o”srr'or can they by
a‘rryr'na't‘liodllnd' their way into bodies after they are
fully formed; for theywill 'neither be able to unite
themselves with a nice precision nor will any con-
nexion of mutual sensation be formed between them.
