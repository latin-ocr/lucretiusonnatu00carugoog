can tell how small a fraction of these an image is, or
express that sum in language. a

Now mark: how swift the motion is with which
idols are borne along, and what velocity is assigned
to them as they glide through the air, so that but a
short hour is spent on ajourney through long space,
whatever the spot towards which they go with a
movement os varied tendency, all this I will tell in
sweetly worded rather than in many verses ; as the
short song os the swan is better than the loud noise
of cranes scattered abroad amid the ethereal clouds os

the south. First ol all we may very osten observe ,

that things which are light and made of minute bodies ἔ
are swift. Of this kind are the light of the sun and Ι
its heat, because they are made of minute first things

which are knocked forward so to speak and do not ’

hesitate to pass through the space ol air between,
ever driven on by a blow following behind ; lor light
on the instant is supplied by fresh light and brightness
goaded to shew its brightness in what you might call
an ever on-moving team. Theresore in like manner
idols must be able to scour in a moment ol time
through space unspeakable, first because they are
exceeding small and there is a cause at their back to·
carry and impel them far forward; where moreover'
they move on with such winged lightness; next
because when emitted they are possessed os so rare3 ,
a texture, that they can readily pass through any
things and stream as it were through the space ol air
between. Again if those minute bodies of things
which are given out from the inmost depths of these
things, as the light and heat ol the sun, are seen

ina moment os time to glide and spread themselves
