194—250] LUCRETIUS 177

too the baby, like to a sailor cast away by the cruel
waves, lies naked on the ground, speechless, wanting
every furtherance 01 life, soon as nature by the throes
of birth has shed him forth from his mother's womb
11110 the borders of light: he fills the room with a
rueful wauling, as well he may whose destiny it is
to go through in life so many ills. But the different
flocks herds and wild beasts grow up ; they want no
rattles ; to none of thern need be addressed the fond
broken accents 01 the fostering nurse; they ask not
different dresses according to the season; no nor
do they want arms or lofty walls, whereby to protect
their own, the earth itself and nature manifold in
her works producing in plenty all things for all.

First 01 011, since the body 01 the earth and water
and the light breath of air and buming heats, out
of which this sum 01 things is seen to be formed,
do all consist ol' a body that had a birth and is
mortal, the whole nature of the world must be
reckoned 01 0 like body. For those things whosel
parts and members we see to be 01 0 body that had
a birth and 01 forms that are mortal, we perceive
to be likewise without exception mortal, and at the
same time to have had a birth. Since therefore 1
see that the chiefest members and parts 01 the world
are destroyed and begotten anew, 1 may be sure that
101 heaven and earth as well there has been a time
01 beginning and there will be a time 01 destruction.

And herein that you may not think Ι have un·
fairly seized on this point for myself, because Ι have
assumed that earth and fire are mortal and have
not doubted that water and air perish‚ and have said
that these are likewise begotten and grow afresh,
