48 LUCRETIUS [soon 11

too with what soree the liquid ol water spits out
logs and beams? the more deeply we have pushed
them sheer down and have pressed them in, many of ’
us together, with all our might and much painsul
effort, with the greater avidity it vomits them up and
casts them forth, so that they rise and start out more
than half their length And yetfmethinkswe doubt
not that these, so far as in them is, are allhorue
downwards through the empty void. ln the same
way flames also ought to be able, when squeezed out,
to mount upward through the air, although their
weights‚ so lar as in them is, strive to draw them
down. See you not too that the nightly meteors of
'heaven as they fly alost draw alter them long trails

‚t =l· of flames in whatever direction nature has given

tr, them a passage? Do you not perceive stars and
*maij constellations sall to the earth? The sun also srorn

'³3³³' the height os heaven sheds its heat on all sides

«ᾖ ““ and sows the fields with light; to the earths there-

Ν ἰοτςμε well the suu's heat tends. Lightnings also
you see fly athwart the rains: now from this side)
now from that fires burst from the clouds and rush
about· ‚ the force ol flame falls to the earth all
round.

This poinotoo,herein we wish you to apprehend:
when bodies are borne downwards sheer through void
. by their own weights, at quite uncertain times and
χ uncertain spots they push themselves a little from

x their course: you just and only just can call ita
⁴ change of inclination If they were not used to
” swerve, they would all fall down, like drops os rain,
through the deep void, and no clashing would have

been begotten nor blow produced among the first·
