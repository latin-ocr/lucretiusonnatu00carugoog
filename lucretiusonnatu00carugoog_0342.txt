possess. First os all, as to the name Avernian by
which they are called, it has been given to them from
their real nature, because they are noxious to all

opposite those spots, they sorget to row with their

such spots ; and next we imagine that the manes
gods from beneath do haply draw souis down from
them to the borders of Acheron; as wingfooted

stags are supposed osten by their scent to draw out
