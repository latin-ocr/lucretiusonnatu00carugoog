the mind possesses that heat which it displays when
1 it boils up in anger and fire flashes from the keen
eyes ; there is too much cold spirit comrade of sear,
which spreads a shivering over the limbs and stirs
the whole frame3 yes aud there is also that condition

anger applied to it stimulate it too much, shedding
over it the shadow os murky gloom, nor is it trans·
fixed and stiffened by the icy shaits of sear: it lies
between the other two, stags and cruel lions. And

men and the tempers which follow upon these, ΐ
