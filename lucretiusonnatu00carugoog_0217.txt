- by active motion, and many particles are pressed out
from the depths of the frame and carried off by
sweating, many breathed out through the mouth, ,
when they pant from exhaustion‚ from such causes
the body becomes rarefied and the whole nature
undermined; and this state is attended by pain.
Food therefore is taken in order to give support to
the frame and recruit the strength by its infusion,
and to close up the open-mouthed craving for meat
throughout limbs and veins. The moisture too
passes into all the parts which call for moisture; and
many accumulated bodies 01 heat which cause a
burning in our stomach, the approach of liquid
scatters and quenches as 11 they were fire, so that dry

heat can no longer parch the frame. In this way
then you see gasping thirst is drenched out of our

body, in this way the hungry craving is satisfied.
Now how it comesto pass that we are able to

step out when we please, and how it is given us
to move about our limbs‚ and what cause is wont to
push forward the great load 01 this our body I will
teli: do you take in my words. Ι say that idols of
walking first present themselves to our mind and
strike on the mind, as we said before: then the will
arises; for no one begins to do anything, until his?
mind has first determined what it wills. From the
very fact that it determines such thing, there is an
image 01 that thing. When therefore the mind· bestirs ’ 1
itself in such a way as to will to walk and step out, it ;
strikes at the same moment the force of the soul which ‘ ’
is spread over the whole body throughout the limbs¹ 1

, and frame; and this is easily done, since the whole is j ¹ ·
held in close union with the mind. Nextthesouh‘m‘usu ·
