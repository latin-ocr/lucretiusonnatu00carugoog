which we add of ourselves, taking those thingsn as

nothing is harder than to separate manifest facts from
doubtful which straightway the mind adds on of itself. y*
Again if a man believe that nothing is known, he
knows not whether this even can be known, since “
he admits he knows nothing. l will therefore
decline to argue the case against him who places
himself with head where his feet should be And yet
granting that he knows this, I would still put this
question, since he has never yet seen any truth in
things, whence he knows what knowing and not
knowing severally are, and what it is that has
produced the knowledge of the true and the false
and what has proved the doubtful to differ from the
certain You will find that from the senses first has ¹
proceeded the knowledge of the true and that the pop*
senses cannot be refu ted. For that which 1s of itself {ili
to be able to refute things false by true things must
from the nature of the case be proved to have the p&
higher certainty. Well then what must fairly be
accounted of higher certainty than sense? Shall
reason founded on false sense be able to contradict
them, wholly founded as it is on the senses? and if
they are not true, then¹ all reason as well is rendered
false. Or shall the ears be *able to take the eyes to
task, or the touch the ears? Again shall the taste
call in question this touch, or the nostrils refute or
the eyes controvert it? Not s0, I guess3 for each
