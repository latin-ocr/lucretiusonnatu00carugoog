1079-1134] LUCRETIUS 261

we suppose between the climate os the Briton and
that of Egypt where the poleos heaven slants askew,
and again between that in Pontus and that os Gades
and so on to the races ol men black with sun-baked
complexioni Now as we see these four climates
under the four opposite winds and quarters of heaven
all differing from each other, so also the complexions
and faces of the men are seen to differ widely and
diseases varying in kind are found to seize upon
the different races There is the elephant disease
which is generated beside the streams os Nile in the
midst os Egypt and nowhere else In Attica the
feet are attacked and the eyes in Achaean lands.
And so different places are hurtsul to different parts
and members: the variations ol air occasion that.

Theresore when an atmosphere which happens to put

itsell in motion unsuited to us and a hurtful air begin
to advance, they creep slowly on in the shape of
mist and cloud and disorder everything in their line
os advance and compel all to changeÍ¾ and when
they have at length reached our atmosphere, they
corrupt it too and make it like to themselves and
unsuited to us. This new destroying power and
pestilence therefore all at once either fall upon the
waters or else sink deep into the corn-crops or other
lood of man and provender of beast3 or else their
force remains suspended within the atmosphere, and
when we inhale from it mixed airs, we must absorb
at the same time into our body those things as well.
In like manner pestilence often falls on kine also
and a distemper too on the silly sheep. And it
makes no difference whether we travel to places

unfavourable to us and change the atmosphere witred
