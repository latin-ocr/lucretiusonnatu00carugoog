law of nature it comes to pass that iron can be
attracted by that stone which the Greeks call the
Magnet from the name oi its native place, because it
has its origin within the bounds os the country of the
Magnesians This stone rnen wonder at; as it often¹
produces a chain of rings hanging down from it
Thus you may see sometimes five and more sus-
pended in succession and tossing about in the light
airs, one always hanging down from one 'and attached
to its lower side, and each in turn one from the
other experiencing the binding power of the stone:
with such a continued current its force flies through
all.

In things os this kind many points must be
established before you can assign the true law os
the thing in question, and it must be approached bya
very circuitous road; wherefore all the more Icall sor
an attentive ear and mind.

In the first place from all things whatsoever which
we see there must incessantly stream and be dis-
· charged and scattered abroad such bodies as strike
the eyes and provoke vision. Smells too incessantly
stream from certain things ; as does cold from rivers,
heat from the sun, spray from the waves of the sea,
that eater into walls near the shore. Various sounds
too cease not to stream through the air. Then a
moist salt flavour often comes into the mouth, when
we are moving about beside the sea ; and when we
look on at the mixing os a decoction of wormwood,
its bitterness affects us. In such a constant stream

from all things the several qualities os things are
carried and are transmitted in all directions round,
and no delay, no respite in the how is ever granted,
