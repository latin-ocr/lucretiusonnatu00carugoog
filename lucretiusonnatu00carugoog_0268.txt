,first-beginnings of things many in number in many
ways impelled by blows for infinite ,ages back and
kept in motion by their own weights have been wont
to be carried ¹along and to unite in all manner oi
ways and thoroughly to test every kind ol production
possible by their mutual combinations‚ therefore it is
that spread abroad through great time after trying
unions and motions of every kind they at length meet
together in those masses which suddenly brought
together become olten the rudiments oi great things,
oi earth sea andheaven and the race of living things.
At this time then neither could the sun’s disk be ’
discerned flying aloit with its abundant light, nor
the stars oi great ether, nor sea nor heaven, no nor
earth nor air, nor could any thing be seen like to our
things, but only a strange stormy crisis and medley,
gathered together out of first-beginnings oi every
kind, whose state of discord 'joining battle disordered
their interspaces passages connexions weights blows
clashings and motions, because by reason of their
unlike forms and varied shapes they could not all
remain thus joined together nor fall into mutually
harmonious motions. Then next the several parts
began to fly asunder and things to be joined like with
like and to mark off the world and portion out

’ its members and arrange its mighty parts, that is to

say, to separate high heaven from earth, and let the
sea spread itself out apart with its unmixed water,
and likewise let the lires ol ether spread apart pure
and unmixed.

For first the several bodies ol earth, because they
were heavy and closely entangled‚ met together ln
